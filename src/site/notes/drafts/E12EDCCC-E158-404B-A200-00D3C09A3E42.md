> :memo: **WARNING** SHIM DEPRECATION

>

> With the release of Chocolatey CLI v1.0.0 we have deprecated the following shims/shortcuts:

>

> - chocolatey (Alias for choco)

> - cinst (Shortcut for choco install)

> - cpush (Shortcut for choco push)

> - cuninst (Shortcut for choco uninstall)

> - cup (Shortcut for choco upgrade)

>

> We recommend that any scripts calling these shims be updated to use the full command, as

> these shims will be removed in Chocolatey CLI v2.0.0.



# List/Search Command (choco list)



Chocolatey will perform a search for a package local or remote.



> :memo: **NOTE** 100% compatible with older Chocolatey client (0.9.8.x and below) 

 with options and switches. In most cases you can still pass options 

 and switches  with one dash (`-`). For more details, see 

 [how to pass arguments](xref:choco-commands#how-to-pass-options-switches) (`choco -?`).



## Usage



    choco find <filter> [<options/switches>]

    choco list <filter> [<options/switches>]

    choco search <filter> [<options/switches>]

    clist <filter> [<options/switches>] (DEPRECATED, will be removed in v2.0.0)



## DEPRECATION NOTICE



Starting in v2.0.0 the list command will be made local only and will only

 work with the installed packages. All options available for connecting

 to sources will be removed and can only be used when using [`search`](xref:choco-command-search) or

 `find`.



To avoid breakage, change any calls made to remote sources to use [`choco search`](xref:choco-command-search)

 or `choco find` instead. These will continue to work as usual.



Starting in v2.0.0 the shortcut [`clist`](xref:choco-command-list) will be removed and can not be used

 to list package anymore. We recommend you make sure that you always

 use the full command going forward ([`choco list`](xref:choco-command-list)).



## Examples



    choco list --local-only (DEPRECATED: will be default for list in v2.0.0)

    choco list -li

    choco list -lai

    choco list --page=0 --page-size=25

    choco search git

    choco search git --source="'https://somewhere/out/there'"

    choco search bob -s "'https://somewhere/protected'" -u user -p pass



> :memo: **NOTE** See scripting in [how to pass arguments](xref:choco-commands#how-to-pass-options-switches) (`choco -?`) for how to 

 write proper scripts and integrations.





## Exit Codes



Exit codes that normally result from running this command.



Normal:

 - 0: operation was successful, no issues detected

 - -1 or 1: an error has occurred



Enhanced:

 - 0: operation was successful, no issues detected

 - -1 or 1: an error has occurred

 - 2: no results (enhanced)



> :memo: **NOTE** Starting in v0.10.12, if you have the feature 'useEnhancedExitCodes' 

 turned on, then choco will provide enhanced exit codes that allow 

 better integration and scripting.



If you find other exit codes that we have not yet documented, please 

 file a ticket so we can document it at 

 https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/new/choose.





## See It In Action



![choco list](/assets/images/gifs/choco_search.gif)





## Alternative Sources



Will be removed for the list command in v2.0.0.



Available in 0.9.10+.



### WebPI

This specifies the source is Web PI (Web Platform Installer) and that 

 we are searching for a WebPI product, such as IISExpress. If you do 

 not have the Web PI command line installed, it will install that first 

 and then perform the search requested.

 e.g. `choco list --source webpi`



### Windows Features

This specifies that the source is a Windows Feature and we should 

 install via the Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool (DISM) 

 on the local machine.

 e.g. `choco list --source windowsfeatures`



## Options and Switches



> :memo: **NOTE** Options and switches apply to all items passed, so if you are

 running a command like install that allows installing multiple

 packages, and you use `--version=1.0.0`, it is going to look for and

 try to install version 1.0.0 of every package passed. So please split

 out multiple package calls when wanting to pass specific options.

## How To Pass Options / Switches



You can pass options and switches in the following ways:



 * Unless stated otherwise, an option/switch should only be passed one

   time. Otherwise you may find weird/non-supported behavior.

 * `-`, `/`, or `--` (one character switches should not use `--`)

 * **Option Bundling / Bundled Options**: One character switches can be

   bundled. e.g. `-d` (debug), `-f` (force), `-v` (verbose), and `-y`

   (confirm yes) can be bundled as `-dfvy`.

 * > :memo: **NOTE** If `debug` or `verbose` are bundled with local options

   (not the global ones above), some logging may not show up until after

   the local options are parsed.

 * **Use Equals**: You can also include or not include an equals sign

   `=` between options and values.

 * **Quote Values**: When you need to quote an entire argument, such as

   when using spaces, please use a combination of double quotes and

   apostrophes (`"'value'"`). In cmd.exe you can just use double quotes

   (`"value"`) but in powershell.exe you should use backticks

   (`` `"value`" ``) or apostrophes (`'value'`). Using the combination

   allows for both shells to work without issue, except for when the next

   section applies.

 * **Pass quotes in arguments**: When you need to pass quoted values to

   to something like a native installer, you are in for a world of fun. In

   cmd.exe you must pass it like this: `-ia "/yo=""Spaces spaces"""`. In

   PowerShell.exe, you must pass it like this: `-ia '/yo=""Spaces spaces""'`.

   No other combination will work. In PowerShell.exe if you are on version

   v3+, you can try `--%` before `-ia` to just pass the args through as is,

   which means it should not require any special workarounds.

 * **Periods in PowerShell**: If you need to pass a period as part of a

   value or a path, PowerShell doesn't always handle it well. Please

   quote those values using "Quote Values" section above.

 * Options and switches apply to all items passed, so if you are

   installing multiple packages, and you use `--version=1.0.0`, choco

   is going to look for and try to install version 1.0.0 of every

   package passed. So please split out multiple package calls when

   wanting to pass specific options.



## Scripting / Integration - Best Practices / Style Guide



When writing scripts, such as PowerShell scripts passing options and

switches, there are some best practices to follow to ensure that you

don't run into issues later. This also applies to integrations that

are calling Chocolatey and parsing output. Chocolatey **uses**

PowerShell, but it is an exe, so it cannot return PowerShell objects.



Following these practices ensures both readability of your scripts AND

compatibility across different versions and editions of Chocolatey.

Following this guide will ensure your experience is not frustrating

based on choco not receiving things you think you are passing to it.



 * For consistency, always use `choco`, not `choco.exe`. Never use

   shortcut commands like `cinst` or `cup` (The shortcuts `cinst`

   and `cup` will be removed in v2.0.0).

 * Always have the command as the first argument to `choco`. e.g.

   [`choco install`](xref:choco-command-install), where [`install`](xref:choco-command-install) is the command.

 * If there is a subcommand, ensure that is the second argument. e.g.

   `choco source list`, where `source` is the command and [`list`](xref:choco-command-list) is the

   subcommand.

 * Typically the subject comes next. If installing packages, the

   subject would be the package names, e.g. `choco install pkg1 pkg2`.

 * Never use 'nupkg' or point directly to a nupkg file UNLESS using

   'choco push'. Use the source folder instead, e.g. `choco install

   <package id> --source="'c:\folder\with\package'"` instead of

   `choco install DoNotDoThis.1.0.nupkg` or `choco install DoNotDoThis

    --source="'c:\folder\with\package\DoNotDoThis.1.0.nupkg'"`.

 * Switches and parameters are called simply options. Options come

   after the subject. e.g. `choco install pkg1 --debug --verbose`.

 * Never use the force option (`--force`/`-f`) in scripts (or really

   otherwise as a default mode of use). Force is an override on

   Chocolatey behavior. If you are wondering why Chocolatey isn't doing

   something like the documentation says it should, it's likely because

   you are using force. Stop.

 * Always use full option name. If the short option is `-n`, and the

   full option is `--name`, use `--name`. The only acceptable short

   option for use in scripts is `-y`. Find option names in help docs

   online or through `choco -?` /`choco [Command Name] -?`.

 * For scripts that are running automated, always use `-y`. Do note

   that even with `-y` passed, some things / state issues detected will

   temporarily stop for input - the key here is temporarily. They will

   continue without requiring any action after the temporary timeout

   (typically 30 seconds).

 * Full option names are prepended with two dashes, e.g. `--` or

   `--debug --verbose --ignore-proxy`.

 * When setting a value to an option, always put an equals (`=`)

   between the name and the setting, e.g. `--source="'local'"`.

 * When setting a value to an option, always surround the value

   properly with double quotes bookending apostrophes, e.g.

   `--source="'internal_server'"`.

 * If you are building PowerShell scripts, you can most likely just

   simply use apostrophes surrounding option values, e.g.

   `--source='internal_server'`.

 * Prefer upgrade to install in scripts. You can't [`install`](xref:choco-command-install) to a newer

   version of something, but you can [`choco upgrade`](xref:choco-command-upgrade) which will do both

   upgrade or install (unless switched off explicitly).

 * If you are sharing the script with others, pass `--source` to be

   explicit about where the package is coming from. Use full link and

   not source name ('https://community.chocolatey.org/api/v2' versus

   'chocolatey').

 * If parsing output, you might want to use `--limit-output`/`-r` to

   get output in a more machine parseable format. > :memo: **NOTE** Not all

   commands handle return of information in an easily digestible

   output.

 * Use exit codes to determine status. Chocolatey exits with 0 when

   everything worked appropriately and other exits codes like 1 when

   things error. There are package specific exit codes that are

   recommended to be used and reboot indicating exit codes as well. To

   check exit code when using PowerShell, immediately call

   `$exitCode = $LASTEXITCODE` to get the value choco exited with.



Here's an example following bad practices (line breaks added for

 readability):



  `choco install pkg1 -y -params '/Option:Value /Option2:value with

   spaces' --c4b-option 'Yaass' --option-that-is-new 'dude upgrade'`



Now here is that example written with best practices (again line

 breaks added for readability - there are not line continuations

 for choco):



  `choco upgrade pkg1 -y --source="'https://community.chocolatey.org/api/v2'"

   --package-parameters="'/Option:Value /Option2:value with spaces'"

   --c4b-option="'Yaass'" --option-that-is-new="'dude upgrade'"`



Note the differences between the two:

 * Which is more self-documenting?

 * Which will allow for the newest version of something installed or

   upgraded to (which allows for more environmental consistency on

   packages and versions)?

 * Which may throw an error on a badly passed option?

 * Which will throw errors on unknown option values? See explanation

   below.



Chocolatey ignores options it doesn't understand, but it can only

 ignore option values if they are tied to the option with an

 equals sign ('='). Note those last two options in the examples above?

 If you roll off of a commercial edition or someone with older version

 attempts to run the badly crafted script `--c4b-option 'Yaass'

 --option-that-is-new 'dude upgrade'`, they are likely to see errors on

 'Yaass' and 'dude upgrade' because they are not explicitly tied to the

 option they are written after. Now compare that to the other script.

 Choco will ignore `--c4b-option="'Yaass'"` and

 `--option-that-is-new="'dude upgrade'"` as a whole when it doesn't

 register the options. This means that your script doesn't error.



Following these scripting best practices will ensure your scripts work

 everywhere they are used and with newer versions of Chocolatey.

## Default Options and Switches



> :memo: **NOTE** Options and switches apply to all items passed, so if you are

 running a command like install that allows installing multiple

# Info Command (choco info)



Chocolatey will perform a search for a package local or remote and provide 

 detailed information about that package. This is a synonym for 

 `choco search <pkgname> --exact --detailed`.



> :memo: **NOTE** New as of 0.9.10.0.





## Usage



    choco info [<options/switches>]



## Examples



    choco info chocolatey

    choco info googlechrome

    choco info powershell



> :memo: **NOTE** See scripting in [how to pass arguments](xref:choco-commands#how-to-pass-options-switches) (`choco -?`) for how to 

 write proper scripts and integrations.





## Exit Codes



Exit codes that normally result from running this command.



Normal:

 - 0: operation was successful, no issues detected

 - -1 or 1: an error has occurred



Enhanced:

 - 0: operation was successful, no issues detected

 - -1 or 1: an error has occurred

 - 2: no results (enhanced)



> :memo: **NOTE** Starting in v0.10.12, if you have the feature 'useEnhancedExitCodes' 

 turned on, then choco will provide enhanced exit codes that allow 

 better integration and scripting.



If you find other exit codes that we have not yet documented, please 

 file a ticket so we can document it at 

 https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/new/choose.





## Options and Switches



> :memo: **NOTE** Options and switches apply to all items passed, so if you are

 running a command like install that allows installing multiple

 packages, and you use `--version=1.0.0`, it is going to look for and

 try to install version 1.0.0 of every package passed. So please split

 out multiple package calls when wanting to pass specific options.

# List/Search Command (choco find)



Chocolatey will perform a search for a package local or remote.



> :memo: **NOTE** 100% compatible with older Chocolatey client (0.9.8.x and below) 

 with options and switches. In most cases you can still pass options 

 and switches  with one dash (`-`). For more details, see 

 [how to pass arguments](xref:choco-commands#how-to-pass-options-switches) (`choco -?`).



## Usage



    choco find <filter> [<options/switches>]

    choco list <filter> [<options/switches>]

    choco search <filter> [<options/switches>]

    clist <filter> [<options/switches>] (DEPRECATED, will be removed in v2.0.0)



## Examples



    choco list --local-only (DEPRECATED: will be default for list in v2.0.0)

    choco list -li

    choco list -lai

    choco list --page=0 --page-size=25

    choco search git

    choco search git --source="'https://somewhere/out/there'"

    choco search bob -s "'https://somewhere/protected'" -u user -p pass



> :memo: **NOTE** See scripting in [how to pass arguments](xref:choco-commands#how-to-pass-options-switches) (`choco -?`) for how to

 write proper scripts and integrations.





## Exit Codes



Exit codes that normally result from running this command.



Normal:

 - 0: operation was successful, no issues detected

 - -1 or 1: an error has occurred



Enhanced:

 - 0: operation was successful, no issues detected

 - -1 or 1: an error has occurred

 - 2: no results (enhanced)



> :memo: **NOTE** Starting in v0.10.12, if you have the feature 'useEnhancedExitCodes'

 https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/new/choose.





## See It In Action



![choco find](/assets/images/gifs/choco_search.gif)





## Alternative Sources



Available in 0.9.10+.



### WebPI

This specifies the source is Web PI (Web Platform Installer) and that

 we are searching for a WebPI product, such as IISExpress. If you do

 not have the Web PI command line installed, it will install that first

 and then perform the search requested.

 e.g. `choco find --source webpi`



### Windows Features

This specifies that the source is a Windows Feature and we should

 install via the Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool (DISM)

 on the local machine.

 e.g. `choco find --source windowsfeatures`



## Options and Switches



> :memo: **NOTE** Options and switches apply to all items passed, so if you are

# Export Command (choco export)



Export all currently installed packages to a file.



This is especially helpful when re-building a machine that was created

using Chocolatey.  Export all packages to a file, and then re-install

those packages onto new machine using `choco install packages.config`.



> :memo: **NOTE** Available with 0.11.0+.



## Usage



    choco export [<options/switches>]



## Examples



    choco export

    choco export --include-version-numbers

    choco export "'c:\temp\packages.config'"

    choco export "'c:\temp\packages.config'" --include-version-numbers

    choco export -o="'c:\temp\packages.config'"

    choco export -o="'c:\temp\packages.config'" --include-version-numbers

    choco export --output-file-path="'c:\temp\packages.config'"

    choco export --output-file-path="'c:\temp\packages.config'" --include-version-numbers



> :memo: **NOTE** See scripting in [how to pass arguments](xref:choco-commands#how-to-pass-options-switches) (`choco -?`) for how to

 write proper scripts and integrations.





## Exit Codes



Exit codes that normally result from running this command.



Normal:

 - 0: operation was successful, no issues detected

 - -1 or 1: an error has occurred



If you find other exit codes that we have not yet documented, please

 file a ticket so we can document it at

 https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/new/choose.





## Options and Switches



> :memo: **NOTE** Options and switches apply to all items passed, so if you are

 running a command like install that allows installing multiple

 packages, and you use `--version=1.0.0`, it is going to look for and

 try to install version 1.0.0 of every package passed. So please split

 out multiple package calls when wanting to pass specific options.

# Upgrade Command (choco upgrade)



Upgrades a package or a list of packages. If you do not have a package

 installed, upgrade will install it.



> :memo: **NOTE** 100% compatible with older Chocolatey client (0.9.8.x and below)

 with options and switches. Add `-y` for previous behavior with no

 prompt. In most cases you can still pass options and switches with one

 dash (`-`). For more details, see [how to pass arguments](xref:choco-commands#how-to-pass-options-switches) (`choco -?`).



## DEPRECATION NOTICE



Starting in v2.0.0 the shortcut `cup` will be removed and can not be used

to upgrade or install packages anymore. We recommend you make sure that you always

use the full command going forward ([`choco upgrade`](xref:choco-command-upgrade)).



## Usage



    choco upgrade <pkg|all> [<pkg2> <pkgN>] [<options/switches>]

    cup <pkg|all> [<pkg2> <pkgN>] [<options/switches>] (DEPRECATED, will be removed in v2.0.0)



> :memo: **NOTE** `all` is a special package keyword that will allow you to upgrade

 all currently installed packages.



Skip upgrading certain packages with [`choco pin`](xref:choco-command-pin) or with the option

 `--except`.



> :memo: **NOTE** [Chocolatey Pro](https://chocolatey.org/compare) / Business automatically synchronizes with

 Programs and Features, ensuring automatically updating apps' versions

 (like Chrome) are up to date in Chocolatey's repository.



## Examples



    choco upgrade chocolatey

    choco upgrade notepadplusplus googlechrome atom 7zip

    choco upgrade notepadplusplus googlechrome atom 7zip -dvfy

    choco upgrade git -y --params="'/GitAndUnixToolsOnPath /NoAutoCrlf'"

    choco upgrade git -y --params="'/GitAndUnixToolsOnPath /NoAutoCrlf'" --install-args="'/DIR=C:\git'"

    # Params are package parameters, passed to the package

    # Install args are installer arguments, appended to the silentArgs 

    #  in the package for the installer itself

    choco upgrade nodejs.install --version 0.10.35

    choco upgrade git -s "'https://somewhere/out/there'"

    choco upgrade git -s "'https://somewhere/protected'" -u user -p pass

    choco upgrade all

    choco upgrade all --except="'skype,conemu'"

# Outdated Command (choco outdated)



Returns a list of outdated packages.



> :memo: **NOTE** Available with 0.9.9.6+.





## Usage



    choco outdated [<options/switches>]



## Examples



    choco outdated

    choco outdated -s https://somewhere/out/there

    choco outdated -s "'https://somewhere/protected'" -u user -p pass



If you use `--source=https://somewhere/out/there`, it is 

 going to look for outdated packages only based on that source, so 

 you may want to add `--ignore-unfound` to your options.



> :memo: **NOTE** See scripting in [how to pass arguments](xref:choco-commands#how-to-pass-options-switches) (`choco -?`) for how to 

 write proper scripts and integrations.





## Exit Codes



Exit codes that normally result from running this command.



Normal:

 - 0: operation was successful, no issues detected

 - -1 or 1: an error has occurred



Enhanced:

 - 0: no outdated packages

 - -1 or 1: an error has occurred

 - 2: outdated packages have been found



> :memo: **NOTE** Starting in v0.10.12, if you have the feature 'useEnhancedExitCodes' 

 turned on, then choco will provide enhanced exit codes that allow 

 better integration and scripting.



If you find other exit codes that we have not yet documented, please 

 file a ticket so we can document it at 

 https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/new/choose.

# Source Command (choco sources)



Chocolatey will allow you to interact with sources.



> :memo: **NOTE** Mostly compatible with older chocolatey client (0.9.8.x and

 below) with options and switches. When enabling, disabling or removing

 a source, use `-name` in front of the option now. In most cases you

 can still pass options and switches with one dash (`-`). For more

 details, see [how to pass arguments](xref:choco-commands#how-to-pass-options-switches) (`choco -?`).



## Usage



    choco source [list]|add|remove|disable|enable [<options/switches>]

    choco sources [list]|add|remove|disable|enable [<options/switches>]



## Examples



    choco source

    choco source list

    choco source add -n=bob -s="https://somewhere/out/there/api/v2/"

    choco source add -n=bob -s "'https://somewhere/out/there/api/v2/'" -cert=\Users\bob\bob.pfx

    choco source add -n=bob -s "'https://somewhere/out/there/api/v2/'" -u=bob -p=12345

    choco source disable -n=bob

    choco source enable -n=bob

    choco source remove -n=bob



When it comes to the source location, this can be a folder/file share or an http

location. If it is a url, it will be a location you can go to in a browser and

it returns OData with something that says Packages in the browser, similar to

what you see when you go to https://community.chocolatey.org/api/v2/.



> :memo: **NOTE** See scripting in [how to pass arguments](xref:choco-commands#how-to-pass-options-switches) (`choco -?`) for how to

 write proper scripts and integrations.





## Exit Codes



Exit codes that normally result from running this command.



Normal:

 - 0: operation was successful, no issues detected

 - -1 or 1: an error has occurred



If you find other exit codes that we have not yet documented, please

 file a ticket so we can document it at

 https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/new/choose.





## Options and Switches



> :memo: **NOTE** Options and switches apply to all items passed, so if you are

 running a command like install that allows installing multiple

 packages, and you use `--version=1.0.0`, it is going to look for and

 try to install version 1.0.0 of every package passed. So please split

 out multiple package calls when wanting to pass specific options.

# ApiKey Command (choco setapikey)



This lists api keys that are set or sets an api key for a particular

 source so it doesn't need to be specified every time.



Anything that doesn't contain source and key will list api keys.



## Usage



    choco apikey [<options/switches>]

    choco setapikey [<options/switches>]



## Examples



    choco apikey

    choco apikey -s https://somewhere/out/there

    choco apikey -s="https://somewhere/out/there/" -k="value"

    choco apikey -s "https://push.chocolatey.org/" -k="123-123123-123"

    choco apikey -s "http://internal_nexus" -k="user:password"



For source location, this can be a folder/file share or an

http location. When it comes to urls, they can be different from the packages

url (where packages are searched and installed from). As an example, for

Chocolatey's community package package repository, the package url is

https://community.chocolatey.org/api/v2/, but the push url is https://push.chocolatey.org

(and the deprecated https://chocolatey.org/ as a push url). Check the

documentation for your choice of repository to learn what the push url is.



For the key, this can be an apikey that is provided by your source repository.

With some sources, like Nexus, this can be a NuGet API key or it could be a

user name and password specified as 'user:password' for the API key. Please see

your repository's documentation (for Nexus, please see

https://ch0.co/nexus2apikey).



> :memo: **NOTE** See scripting in [how to pass arguments](xref:choco-commands#how-to-pass-options-switches) (`choco -?`) for how to

 write proper scripts and integrations.





## Connecting to Chocolatey.org (Community Package Repository)



In order to save your API key for https://push.chocolatey.org/,

 log in (or register, confirm and then log in) to

 https://push.chocolatey.org/, go to https://push.chocolatey.org/account,

 copy the API Key, and then use it in the following command:



    choco apikey -k <your key here> -s https://push.chocolatey.org/





## Exit Codes



Exit codes that normally result from running this command.



Normal:

 - 0: operation was successful, no issues detected

 - -1 or 1: an error has occurred



If you find other exit codes that we have not yet documented, please

 file a ticket so we can document it at

 https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/new/choose.





## Options and Switches



> :memo: **NOTE** Options and switches apply to all items passed, so if you are

 running a command like install that allows installing multiple

 packages, and you use `--version=1.0.0`, it is going to look for and

 try to install version 1.0.0 of every package passed. So please split

# Pin Command (choco pin)



Pin a package to suppress upgrades.



This is especially helpful when running [`choco upgrade`](xref:choco-command-upgrade) for all

 packages, as it will automatically skip those packages. Another

 alternative is `choco upgrade --except="pkg1,pk2"`.



## Usage



    choco pin [list]|add|remove [<options/switches>]



## Examples



    choco pin

    choco pin list

    choco pin add -n git

    choco pin add --name="'git'" --version="'1.2.3'"

    choco pin add --name="'git'" --version="'1.2.3'" --reason="'reasons available in business editions only'"

    choco pin remove --name="'git'"



> :memo: **NOTE** See scripting in [how to pass arguments](xref:choco-commands#how-to-pass-options-switches) (`choco -?`) for how to

 write proper scripts and integrations.





## Exit Codes



Exit codes that normally result from running this command.



Normal:

 - 0: operation was successful, no issues detected

 - -1 or 1: an error has occurred



If you find other exit codes that we have not yet documented, please

 file a ticket so we can document it at

 https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/new/choose.





## Options and Switches



> :memo: **NOTE** Options and switches apply to all items passed, so if you are

 running a command like install that allows installing multiple

 packages, and you use `--version=1.0.0`, it is going to look for and

 try to install version 1.0.0 of every package passed. So please split

 out multiple package calls when wanting to pass specific options.

# Install Command (choco install)



Installs a package or a list of packages (sometimes specified as a

 packages.config).



> :memo: **NOTE** 100% compatible with older chocolatey client (0.9.8.32 and below)

 with options and switches. Add `-y` for previous behavior with no

 prompt. In most cases you can still pass options and switches with one

 dash (`-`). For more details, see [how to pass arguments](xref:choco-commands#how-to-pass-options-switches) (`choco -?`).



## DEPRECATION NOTICE



Starting in v2.0.0 the shortcut `cinst` will be removed and can not be used

to install packages anymore. We recommend you make sure that you always

use the full command going forward ([`choco install`](xref:choco-command-install)).



## Usage



    choco install <pkg|packages.config> [<pkg2> <pkgN>] [<options/switches>]

    cinst <pkg|packages.config> [<pkg2> <pkgN>] [<options/switches>] (DEPRECATED, will be removed in v2.0.0)



> :memo: **NOTE** `all` is a special package keyword that will allow you to install

 all packages from a custom feed. Will not work with Chocolatey default

 feed. THIS IS NOT YET REIMPLEMENTED.



> :memo: **NOTE** Any package name ending with .config is considered a

 'packages.config' file. Please see https://ch0.co/packages_config



> :memo: **NOTE** [Chocolatey Pro](https://chocolatey.org/compare) / Business builds on top of a great open source

 experience with quite a few features that enhance the your use of the

 community package repository (when using Pro), and really enhance the

 Chocolatey experience all around. If you are an organization looking

 for a better ROI, look no further than Business - automatic package

 creation from installer files, automatic recompile support, runtime

 malware protection, private CDN download cache, synchronize with

 Programs and Features, etc - https://chocolatey.org/compare.





## Examples



    choco install sysinternals

    choco install notepadplusplus googlechrome atom 7zip

    choco install notepadplusplus --force --force-dependencies

    choco install notepadplusplus googlechrome atom 7zip -dvfy

    choco install git -y --params="'/GitAndUnixToolsOnPath /NoAutoCrlf'"

    choco install git -y --params="'/GitAndUnixToolsOnPath /NoAutoCrlf'" --install-arguments="'/DIR=C:\git'"

    # Params are package parameters, passed to the package

    # Install args are installer arguments, appended to the silentArgs

    #  in the package for the installer itself

    choco install nodejs.install --version 0.10.35

    choco install git -s "'https://somewhere/out/there'"

    choco install git -s "'https://somewhere/protected'" -u user -p pass



Choco can also install directly from a nuspec/nupkg file. This aids in

 testing packages:



    choco install <path/to/nuspec>

    choco install <path/to/nupkg>



Install multiple versions of a package using -m (AllowMultiple versions)



    choco install ruby --version 1.9.3.55100 -my

    choco install ruby --version 2.0.0.59800 -my

    choco install ruby --version 2.1.5 -my



What is `-my`? See option bundling in [how to pass arguments](xref:choco-commands#how-to-pass-options-switches)

 (`choco -?`).



> :memo: **NOTE** All of these will add to PATH variable. We'll be adding a special

 option to not allow PATH changes. Until then you will need to manually

 go modify Path to just one Ruby and then use something like uru

 (https://bitbucket.org/jonforums/uru) or pik

 (https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/pik) to switch between versions.



> :memo: **NOTE** See scripting in [how to pass arguments](xref:choco-commands#how-to-pass-options-switches) (`choco -?`) for how to

 write proper scripts and integrations.





## Exit Codes



Exit codes that normally result from running this command.



Normal:

 - 0: operation was successful, no issues detected

 - -1 or 1: an error has occurred



Package Exit Codes:

 - 1641: success, reboot initiated

 - 3010: success, reboot required

 - other (not listed): likely an error has occurred



In addition to normal exit codes, packages are allowed to exit

 with their own codes when the feature 'usePackageExitCodes' is

 turned on. Uninstall command has additional valid exit codes.

 Available in v0.9.10+.



Reboot Exit Codes:

 - 350: pending reboot detected, no action has occurred

 - 1604: install suspended, incomplete



In addition to the above exit codes, you may also see reboot exit codes

 when the feature 'exitOnRebootDetected' is turned on. It typically requires

 the feature 'usePackageExitCodes' to also be turned on to work properly.

 Available in v0.10.12+.

## Packages.config



Alternative to PackageName. This is a list of packages in an xml manifest for Chocolatey to install. This is like the packages.config that NuGet uses except it also adds other options and switches. This can also be the path to the packages.config file if it is not in the current working directory.



> :memo: **NOTE** The filename is only required to end in .config, the name is not required to be packages.config.

## Alternative Sources



Available in 0.9.10+.



### Ruby

This specifies the source is Ruby Gems and that we are installing a

 gem. If you do not have ruby installed prior to running this command,

 the command will install that first.

 e.g. `choco install compass -source ruby`



### WebPI

This specifies the source is Web PI (Web Platform Installer) and that

 we are installing a WebPI product, such as IISExpress. If you do not

 have the Web PI command line installed, it will install that first and

 then the product requested.

 e.g. `choco install IISExpress --source webpi`



### Cygwin

This specifies the source is Cygwin and that we are installing a cygwin

 package, such as bash. If you do not have Cygwin installed, it will

 install that first and then the product requested.

 e.g. `choco install bash --source cygwin`



### Python

This specifies the source is Python and that we are installing a python

 package, such as Sphinx. If you do not have easy_install and Python

 installed, it will install those first and then the product requested.

 e.g. `choco install sphinx --source python`



### Windows Features

This specifies that the source is a Windows Feature and we should

 install via the Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool (DISM)

 on the local machine.

 e.g. `choco install IIS-WebServerRole --source windowsfeatures`

> :memo: **WARNING** SHIM DEPRECATION

>

> With the release of Chocolatey CLI v1.0.0 we have deprecated the following shims/shortcuts:

>

> - chocolatey (Alias for choco)

> - cinst (Shortcut for choco install)

> - cpush (Shortcut for choco push)

> - cuninst (Shortcut for cuninst)

> - cup (Shortcut for choco upgrade)

>

> We recommend that any scripts calling these shims be updated to use the full command, as

> these shims will be removed in Chocolatey CLI v2.0.0.



# Uninstall Command (choco uninstall)



Uninstalls a package or a list of packages.



> :memo: **NOTE** 100% compatible with older chocolatey client (0.9.8.32 and below)

 with options and switches. Add `-y` for previous behavior with no

 prompt. In most cases you can still pass options and switches with one

 dash (`-`). For more details, see [how to pass arguments](xref:choco-commands#how-to-pass-options-switches) (`choco -?`).



Choco 0.9.9+ automatically tracks registry changes for "Programs and

 Features" of the underlying software's native installers when

 installing packages. The "Automatic Uninstaller" (auto uninstaller)

 service is a feature that can use that information to automatically

 determine how to uninstall these natively installed applications. This

 means that a package may not need an explicit chocolateyUninstall.ps1

 to reverse the installation done in the install script.



Chocolatey tracks packages, which are the files in

 `$env:ChocolateyInstall\lib\packagename`. These packages may or may not

 contain the software (applications/tools) that each package represents.

 The software may actually be installed in Program Files (most native

 installers will install the software there) or elsewhere on the

 machine.



With auto uninstaller turned off, a chocolateyUninstall.ps1 is required

 to perform uninstall from the system. In the absence of

 chocolateyUninstall.ps1, choco uninstall only removes the package from

 Chocolatey but does not remove the software from your system (unless

 in the package directory).



> :memo: **NOTE** A package with a failing uninstall can be removed with the

`-n --skipautouninstaller` flags. This will remove the package from

chocolatey without attempting to uninstall the program.



> :memo: **NOTE** Starting in 0.9.10+, the Automatic Uninstaller (AutoUninstaller)

 is turned on by default. To turn it off, run the following command:



    choco feature disable -n autoUninstaller



> :memo: **NOTE** [Chocolatey Pro](https://chocolatey.org/compare) / Business automatically synchronizes with

 Programs and Features, ensuring manually removed apps are

 automatically removed from Chocolatey's repository.



> :memo: **NOTE** Synchronizer and AutoUninstaller enhancements in licensed

 versions of Chocolatey ensure that Autouninstaller is up to 95%

 effective at removing software without an uninstall script. This is

 because synchronizer ensures the registry snapshot stays up to date

 and licensed enhancements have the ability to inspect more locations

 to determine how to automatically uninstall software.



## DEPRECATION NOTICE



Starting in v2.0.0 the shortcut `cuninst` will be removed and can not be used

to uninstall packages anymore. We recommend you make sure that you always

use the full command going forward ([`choco uninstall`](xref:choco-command-uninstall)).



## Usage



    choco uninstall <pkg|all> [pkg2 pkgN] [options/switches]

    cuninst <pkg|all> [pkg2 pkgN] [options/switches] (DEPRECATED, will be removed in v2.0.0)



> :memo: **NOTE** `all` is a special package keyword that will allow you to

 uninstall all packages.





## See It In Action



![choco uninstall](/assets/images/gifs/choco_uninstall.gif)





## Examples



    choco uninstall git

    choco uninstall notepadplusplus googlechrome atom 7zip

    choco uninstall notepadplusplus googlechrome atom 7zip -dv

    choco uninstall ruby --version 1.8.7.37402

    choco uninstall nodejs.install --all-versions



> :memo: **NOTE** See scripting in [how to pass arguments](xref:choco-commands#how-to-pass-options-switches) (`choco -?`) for how to 

 write proper scripts and integrations.





## Exit Codes



Exit codes that normally result from running this command.



Normal:

 - 0: operation was successful, no issues detected

 - -1 or 1: an error has occurred



Package Exit Codes:

 - 1605: software is not installed

 - 1614: product is uninstalled

 - 1641: success, reboot initiated

 - 3010: success, reboot required

 - other (not listed): likely an error has occurred



In addition to normal exit codes, packages are allowed to exit

 with their own codes when the feature 'usePackageExitCodes' is

 turned on. Available in v0.9.10+.



Reboot Exit Codes:

 - 350: pending reboot detected, no action has occurred

 - 1604: install suspended, incomplete



In addition to the above exit codes, you may also see reboot exit codes

 when the feature 'exitOnRebootDetected' is turned on. It typically requires

 the feature 'usePackageExitCodes' to also be turned on to work properly.

 Available in v0.10.12+.



## Options and Switches



> :memo: **NOTE** Options and switches apply to all items passed, so if you are

 running a command like install that allows installing multiple

 packages, and you use `--version=1.0.0`, it is going to look for and

 try to install version 1.0.0 of every package passed. So please split

 out multiple package calls when wanting to pass specific options.

 installed as packages on Chocolatey. Searches through the system to 

 see software that has been installed and generates packages from that

 software, baselines the packages against Chocolatey and makes the 

 packages available to upload to source.



See https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/features/package-synchronization/





## Usage



    choco sync [<options/switches>]



## Examples



    choco sync

    choco sync --id=putty

    choco sync --id=putty --package-id=putty

## Options and Switches



> :memo: **NOTE** Options and switches apply to all items passed, so if you are

 running a command like install that allows installing multiple

 packages, and you use `--version=1.0.0`, it is going to look for and

 try to install version 1.0.0 of every package passed. So please split

 out multiple package calls when wanting to pass specific options.



Includes [default options/switches](xref:choco-commands#default-options-and-switches) (included below for completeness).

# List/Search Command (choco search)



Chocolatey will perform a search for a package local or remote.



> :memo: **NOTE** 100% compatible with older Chocolatey client (0.9.8.x and below) 

 with options and switches. In most cases you can still pass options 

 and switches  with one dash (`-`). For more details, see 

 [how to pass arguments](xref:choco-commands#how-to-pass-options-switches) (`choco -?`).



## Usage



    choco find <filter> [<options/switches>]

    choco list <filter> [<options/switches>]

    choco search <filter> [<options/switches>]

    clist <filter> [<options/switches>] (DEPRECATED, will be removed in v2.0.0)



## Examples



    choco list --local-only (DEPRECATED: will be default for list in v2.0.0)

    choco list -li

    choco list -lai

    choco list --page=0 --page-size=25

    choco search git

    choco search git --source="'https://somewhere/out/there'"

    choco search bob -s "'https://somewhere/protected'" -u user -p pass



> :memo: **NOTE** See scripting in [how to pass arguments](xref:choco-commands#how-to-pass-options-switches) (`choco -?`) for how to 

 write proper scripts and integrations.





## Exit Codes



Exit codes that normally result from running this command.



Normal:

 - 0: operation was successful, no issues detected

 - -1 or 1: an error has occurred



Enhanced:

 - 0: operation was successful, no issues detected

 - -1 or 1: an error has occurred

 - 2: no results (enhanced)



> :memo: **NOTE** Starting in v0.10.12, if you have the feature 'useEnhancedExitCodes' 

 turned on, then choco will provide enhanced exit codes that allow 

 better integration and scripting.



If you find other exit codes that we have not yet documented, please 

 file a ticket so we can document it at 

 https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/new/choose.





## See It In Action



![choco search](/assets/images/gifs/choco_search.gif)





## Alternative Sources



Available in 0.9.10+.



### WebPI

This specifies the source is Web PI (Web Platform Installer) and that 

 we are searching for a WebPI product, such as IISExpress. If you do 

 not have the Web PI command line installed, it will install that first 

 and then perform the search requested.

 e.g. `choco search --source webpi`



### Windows Features

This specifies that the source is a Windows Feature and we should 

 install via the Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool (DISM) 

 on the local machine.

 e.g. `choco search --source windowsfeatures`

# Download Command (choco download)



### Package Copy / Package Downloader



[Chocolatey Professional](https://chocolatey.org/compare) and up (Pro+) starting in version 1.7.1.



Downloads a package from a source and unpacks it.



### Package Internalizer



[Chocolatey for Business](https://chocolatey.org/compare) (C4B) starting at licensed version 1.5.0.

Chocolatey for Managed Service Providers (MSP) starting in 1.12.1.



Downloads a package from a source, optionally downloading remote

 resources and recompiling the package to use internal resources. This

 takes an existing package and makes it available without any internet

 requirement.



See https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/features/package-internalizer





## Usage



    choco download <pkg> [<options/switches>] [install_script_variable=value]



    Install script variables are values that are discovered in the

     chocolateyInstall.ps1 (or a script it calls). When you find values

     there maybe don't get found and replaced or they use a default

     value and you want to provide a value for them to use instead, you

     can find them and then provide the value you want to pass instead.

     For example, in the Firefox package, it uses a default value of

     'en-US' for `$locale`. If you want to change that, you can add

     `locale` and a value, which will replace `$locale` in the script,

     e.g. `choco download firefox --internalize locale=en-GB`.



## Examples



    choco download sysinternals



    #### [Chocolatey for Business](https://chocolatey.org/compare) / Chocolatey for MSP

    choco download notepadplusplus --internalize

    choco download notepadplusplus.install --internalize --resources-location \\server\share

    choco download notepadplusplus.install --internalize --resources-location http://somewhere/internal --append-useoriginallocation

    choco download KB3033929 --internalize -internalize-all-urls --append-useoriginallocation

# Feature Command (choco features)



Chocolatey will allow you to interact with features.



## Usage



    choco feature [list]|disable|enable [<options/switches>]



## Examples



    choco feature

    choco feature list

    choco feature disable -n=bob

    choco feature enable -n=bob



> :memo: **NOTE** See scripting in [how to pass arguments](xref:choco-commands#how-to-pass-options-switches) (`choco -?`) for how to 

 write proper scripts and integrations.





## Exit Codes



Exit codes that normally result from running this command.



Normal:

 - 0: operation was successful, no issues detected

 - -1 or 1: an error has occurred



If you find other exit codes that we have not yet documented, please 

 file a ticket so we can document it at 

 https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/new/choose.





## Options and Switches



> :memo: **NOTE** Options and switches apply to all items passed, so if you are

 running a command like install that allows installing multiple

 packages, and you use `--version=1.0.0`, it is going to look for and

 try to install version 1.0.0 of every package passed. So please split

 out multiple package calls when wanting to pass specific options.

# Source Command (choco source)



Chocolatey will allow you to interact with sources.



> :memo: **NOTE** Mostly compatible with older chocolatey client (0.9.8.x and

 below) with options and switches. When enabling, disabling or removing

 a source, use `-name` in front of the option now. In most cases you

 can still pass options and switches with one dash (`-`). For more

 details, see [how to pass arguments](xref:choco-commands#how-to-pass-options-switches) (`choco -?`).



## Usage



    choco source [list]|add|remove|disable|enable [<options/switches>]

    choco sources [list]|add|remove|disable|enable [<options/switches>]



## Examples



    choco source

    choco source list

    choco source add -n=bob -s "'https://somewhere/out/there/api/v2/'" -u=bob -p=12345

    choco source disable -n=bob

    choco source enable -n=bob

    choco source remove -n=bob



When it comes to the source location, this can be a folder/file share or an http

location. If it is a url, it will be a location you can go to in a browser and

it returns OData with something that says Packages in the browser, similar to

what you see when you go to https://community.chocolatey.org/api/v2/.
