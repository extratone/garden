I have been having these thoughts for years, now, as someone who always - for whatever gosh darned reason - went to Craigslist first. Basically, the offerings there have dwindled to virtually nill (in terms of reasonably serious offers, anyway.) If that's a dumb question, I promise this is a dumber answer, because I remained confused by this ongoing depletion for like more than 4 straight years? 

Anyway, the answer I have for you ... for better or worse.... is 🆁🅴🅳🅰🅲🆃🅴🅳 **Facebook Marketplace**. I made a new friend over the summer and happened to notice them scrolling through the hellish thing a few weeks ago... I haven't any new information beyond that, but it sure seems like that's where everybody's gone to.
