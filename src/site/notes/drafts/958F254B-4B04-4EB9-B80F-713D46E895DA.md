regarding clipboard managers, (I know I'm a little late,) I've been working on a blog post about the late Copied, why it was so powerful and original, and how the currently-available crop doesn't quite add up to its abilities, which I feel has resulted in some semi-authority on what's available.

as for Me and My House, we use Paste: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/paste-clipboard-manager/id967805235

but Taio has a full clipboard manager built in, basically: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/taio-markdown-text-actions/id1527036273

and Gladys still has some super original powers: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gladys/id1257526927
