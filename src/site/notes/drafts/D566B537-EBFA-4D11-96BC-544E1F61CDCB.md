This is more of a proof of concept - if you want to install it yourself, it requires *a lot* of individualized setup - but I’ve used Working Copy to keep the contents of all 7 of my Tot Dots synced with corresponding .md and .txt files in a GitHub Repository. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/69aa72b435b94d5f82106e4309303072

## Git-enabled Dot sync with Working Copy.

**Requires**
- [Tot Pocket](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tot-pocket/id1498235191)
- [Working Copy](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/working-copy-git-client/id896694807)

![Tot Git](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/162962967-8c365c74-318f-4310-b4d3-938f8ad5bf15.png)

This shortcut uses the new actions present in Iconfactory’s [Tot Pocket](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tot-pocket/id1498235191) to retrieve the contents of all 7 tot dots and write it to corresponding, individual .md and .txt files within a [Working Copy](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/working-copy-git-client/id896694807) repository as well as one combined .md file. By default, all of the `Write Repository Files` actions are set to also stage the written files for commit. (See [my very own ](https://github.com/extratone/tot) as an example, if you’d like.) 

After the files have been written and staged, they are automatically committed with a message in the following format: `Tot Git - MMddYYYY-HHmmss` The repository is then committed. 

Upon installation, you will be asked to specify the path to the target Working Copy repository. Unless you’re using the app’s folders function, though, (`sync/tot`, for example,) you need only enter the case-sensitive name of the repository (e.g. `tot`.)
