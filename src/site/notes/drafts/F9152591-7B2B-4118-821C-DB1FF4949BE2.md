@vital876 @Simplicity_teal next time, you might want to try Text Replacement. I turned off autocorrection and autosuggestions entirely like two weeks after that gosh darned button menu came out lol. my list of declared terms ain’t long, but it *is* fucking useful. here's a shortcut I've made that opens that menu real quick. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/e6d56b3fe8bc40639a60f166315f255b

Apple’s documentation would have you believe that this feature performs only one of the respective two functions represented by the entires in this screenshot.

setting the same value for `Phrase`and `Shortcut` basically achieves the same thing as “Learn Spelling.”
