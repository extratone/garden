- [URL](https://reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/t21vfe/get_raw_version_of_discourse_thread/)

So every Discourse thread (to my knowledge) has a raw version at `/raw/[numericID]`. So for instance, the raw version of `https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/drafts-31-released-interface-refresh-notion-support/12165` is at `https://forums.getdrafts.com/raw/12165`.

I’m sure it’s possible but I'm fairly stumped... How could I do this in Shortcuts? I’m assuming it would involve [Get Component of URL](https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/actions/get-component-of-url/) and splitting by numbers?
