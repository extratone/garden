howdy folks! this is half self-promotional, half-sharing an incredible tool for sharing high-quality audio.

if you remember/use **clyp.it**, you might recall an email you received about a year ago half-explaining the service’s deprecation of its free account tiers. 

in response (sortof,) a very clever and ambitious young UK developer launched **Whyp** in January - a free audio sharing web service featuring 320 kbps playback.

I interviewed him but uh… it’s pretty rough. indulge if you’re curious, but it’s most important that you *give Whyp a try*! https://open.spotify.com/episode/31ozmCpGqLnnIF0MSuxqyW?si=zWwE4JgHRiOtZi3STArqvA
