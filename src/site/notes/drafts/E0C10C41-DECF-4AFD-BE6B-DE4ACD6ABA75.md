You can transfer your passwords from Chrome into 1Password on 1Password.com.

1Password can import your passwords from Chrome. When you import from Chrome:

- Your Chrome passwords will be converted into 1Password logins.
- Only passwords will be imported. Credit cards, addresses, and other items will not be imported.

Chrome import is only available on 1Password.com and requires a 1Password account.

## Step 1: Export your data from Chrome

Before you export your data from Chrome, temporarily turn off any backup software you may be using, so the unencrypted export file isn’t backed up. Then follow these steps on your computer:

1. Click the Chrome menu      in the toolbar and choose Settings.
2. Click Autofill > Passwords.
3. Click      above the list of saved passwords and select “Export passwords”.
4. Click “Export passwords”, and enter the password you use to log in to your computer if asked.
5. Save the file to your desktop.

## Step 2: Import your data into 1Password

To import your data on 1Password.com:

1. In Chrome or another browser, [sign in](https://start.1password.com/signin) to your account on 1Password.com.
2. Click your name in the top right and choose Import.
3. Click Chrome.
4. Choose the vault you want to import your data into. If you’re importing personal data, choose the Personal or Private vault.
5. Click inside the dotted rectangle and select the CSV file you saved to your desktop earlier.
6. Click Import.

If you have any credit cards, bank accounts, addresses, or other items saved in Chrome, copy them manually into 1Password. Open 1Password on your desktop or mobile device and click the + button to add items.

After you’ve imported your information into 1Password, delete the unencrypted CSV file, and turn on any backup software you turned off earlier.

## Step 3: Turn off the built-in password manager in Chrome

To prevent Chrome from interfering with 1Password, [turn off the built-in password manager in Chrome.](https://support.1password.com/disable-browser-password-manager/)

## Step 4: Delete your passwords from Chrome

Chrome will continue to fill saved passwords even after you turn off the built-in password manager. To fill your passwords with 1Password instead of Chrome, delete your saved passwords from Chrome.

Following these steps will permanently delete your passwords from Chrome, and you won’t be able to recover them. Make sure all your passwords from Chrome are saved in 1Password before you delete them.

To delete all your passwords at once:

1. Click the Chrome menu      in the toolbar and choose More tools > Clear browsing data.
2. Select the Advanced tab and choose a time range, like “All time”.
3. Then select “Passwords and other sign-in data” from the list. You can also deselect any data you don’t want to delete.
4. Click “Clear data”.

To delete your passwords individually:

1. Click the Chrome menu      in the toolbar and choose Settings.
2. Click Autofill > Passwords.
3. Click      beside each saved password you want to delete, then select Remove.
