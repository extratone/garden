Workaround: Search for your email address instead.

Pasting text into the search field and searching via Search Mail for Contact on a contact card doesn't work in languages other than English. (93613150)

The High Priority Mail search suggestion isn't available. (93266352)

Mail Search doesn't offer many temporal suggestions. (93109504)

Workaround: Type the full temporal suggestion, such as Last Week.

Send Later always offers Send Now, Send Tonight, Send Tomorrow Night, and Send Later (custom option), without the refinement to have more awareness of the current time. (86647273)

Remind Me messages might not show at the top of the message list until the message list is refreshed. (94046413)

Until indexing has finished and has extracted Rich Links and Documents, the Zero Keyword state can show "No Results Found". (88721787)

Moving a Remind Me message to another mailbox doesn't remove the Remind Me banner. (93671992)

Known issues
If a user long presses on the Add Stop field in route planning, Maps quits unexpectedly. (93206703)

Don't use doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/mapkit/mkmaplandscape, doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/mapkit/mkstandardmapconfiguration/mapmode, doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/mapkit/mkmapview/3930231-configuration, and doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/mapkit/mkstandardmapconfiguration/3930238-showsbuildings. Use their functional equivalents MKMapElevationStyle , MKStandardMapConfiguration.EmphasisStyle , and preferredConfiguration , instead. Additionally, showsBuildings is now deprecated. (93449747)

Explanatory text regarding user credit for photos submitted to the Apple Ratings & Photos might erroneously show up in Settings within Maps, even when that feature isn't enabled or available. (93359446)

Share ETA isn't sent as expected to SMS recipients. (92806604)

The Resume Route option under Siri Suggestions in Maps Home disappears after pausing a multistop trip. (91789671)

Workaround: Go to Recents to find a copy of the saved trip, or re-create the remaining portion of the trip manually.

While Maps is navigating, waking the device from the Lock Screen or ending navigation can cause Maps to quit unexpectedly. (92367898)

Workaround: Restart Maps and the trip resumes.

Maps isn't loading tiles and search result previews on iPads with two or three core CPUs. (94502723)

Workaround: Force quit Maps

Certain strings for Share ETA will not be localized when sharing trip status from one user to another user. (86537613)

Messages

Known Issues
When attempting to reply to an existing thread of replies, the replies might scroll to an incorrect position. (90407282)

Metal

Known Issues
When using the new Metal mesh shaders feature, render pipeline state objects (PSOs) created with a mesh shader stage but without a object shader stage can fail to compile or fail to work correctly on some devices. (89836551)

Workaround: When creating render PSOs with a mesh shader stage, also include a (potentially trivial pass-through) object shader stage.

The MTLResource.gpuHandle is deprecated. (92862429)

Workaround: Use gpuResourceID instead, which functions as a replacement.

Metal Offline Compiler

Known Issues
AppStore TestFlight distribution of apps with Metal Offline Compiler GPU binaries fails and results in validation errors. (93124006)

Workaround: Certain preview test clients with source access might build the app project locally.

Adding a pipeline descriptor that uses MTLLinkedFunctions to a MTLBinaryArchive is unsupported and has undefined runtime behavior. (90776424)

Workaround: Limit use of MTLLinkedFunctions to PSO creation APIs instead of the Metal Binary Archive API.

When using Metal mesh shaders on a device with Apple silicon, object or mesh shaders producing large amounts of output data can result in incorrect rendering and device instability. (93797539)

Workaround: Try reducing the object and mesh output data with the following actions:

Decrease the object dispatch grid size.

Decrease the object shader [[payload|payload]] attribute size.

Decrease the number of generated mesh threadgroups.

Decrease the size of the metal::mesh object.

Alternatively, try splitting the drawMesh call into a series of smaller drawMesh calls (smaller object grids), spread over multiple render encoders.

When using Metal mesh shaders on a device with Apple silicon, vertex buffers set at indices 29 or 30 can become unset after calling any of these methods: drawMeshThreadgroups, drawMeshThreads, drawMeshThreadgroupsWithIndirectBuffer. (93797408)

Workaround: Reset the vertex buffers at indices 29 or 30 after issuing drawMesh calls if needed by subsequent drawPrimitive calls.

When using Metal mesh shaders on a device with Apple silicon, graphics corruption can occur when emitting a metal::mesh with a large number of primitives and using the viewport_array_index, render_target_array_index, or primitive_culled per-primitive attributes. (93797184)

Workaround: Emit 170 or fewer primitives per mesh shader threadgroup when using the viewport_array_index, render_target_array_index, or primitive_culled per-primitive attributes.

The names of classes in MetalFX headers don't match WWDC session. (93712694)

Workaround: Use the names in header files and docs.

MetalFX effect outputs aren't designed to be consumed by the CPU. Outputting to a texture that is read only by the CPU might result in synchronization issues. (91515075)

Workaround: If a CPU reading of the MetalFX output is desired, instead of encoding the MetalFX effect as the last item in a command buffer, encode a dummy blit that consumes the MetalFX output texture (a 1-pixel region blit is fine) in the command buffer. After the command buffer with the dummy blit is finished, reading of the MetalFX effect output texture with CPU synchronizes correctly.

MTLFXTemporalScaler currently only supports an input resolution of â‰¥ 1280 x 720 and an output resolution of exactly 2x. Creating MFXTemporalScalingEffect with other attibutes returns nil for the object creation. (92913479)

The MFXTemporalScalingEffect class quits unexpectedly on creation when using an iPad with an M1 chip. (93278732)

Workaround: Use macOS to test MFXTemporalScalingEffect.

App Store TestFlight distribution of apps with Metal Offline Compiler GPU binaries fails and results in validation errors. (95140728)

Workaround: Clients with source access can build app project locally.

MetalFX

Known Issues
MTLFXTemporalScaler only supports input resolution >= 1280 x 720 in beta 2. Creating MTLFXTemporalScaler will return nil for the object creation for sizes smaller than 1280 x 720. (95390607)

MTLFXTemporalScaler doesn't correctly take into account of exposure of input colors. This could result in poor output reconstruction with ghosting artifacts. (90841083)

Workaround: Feed MetalFX pre-exposed input color buffers where values within are roughly 0-1.

Photos

Known Issues
The Photos background processing can crash, preventing some Photos features from being generated. (93307639)

Posters

Known Issues
While in a focus with a paired poster, creating and setting a new poster via Photos share sheet does not turn off the current focus. (94060721)

Proximity

Known Issues
Precision Finding can fail to connect when near many Bluetooth devices. (90846440)

Workaround: Toggle Bluetooth off and then on.

The NIAlgorithmConvergenceState status property is .notConverged and the NINearbyObjectÂ verticalDirectionEstimate property is .unknown, unless the two devices are within 1 meter of each other. (92987182)

Workaround: Move devices within 1 meter of each other.

RealityKit

Known Issues
Developers using the VideoMaterial API are advised to avoid this SDK in beta 2, as it can cause a RealityKit crash. (95647020)

RoomPlan

Known Issues
The scale of exported USD models is off by factor of 100. (89171270)

RoomCaptureView stubs aren't included in Simulator version. (87738618)

Safari

Known Issues
Reordering a Shared Tab Group by one user reorders that Tab Group for every user in the share. (88779674)

Articles added to the Reading List from the share sheet might not be added as expected. (93457227)

SharePlay

Known Issues
Calling join() can take 30 seconds or longer to transition to the GroupSession.State.joined state. (93688853)

Share Sheet

Known Issues
Share Sheet can hang for several seconds when presenting from SharePlay-enabled applications. (93689970)

Siri

Known Issues
When using the TV Remote app or the TV Remote Control Center widget, using side or home button for Siri on iPhone might stop working. (94008258)

Workaround: Reboot the iPhone.

With Spoken Responses set to Always, Siri can incorrectly respond silently or with succinct dialog instead of verbose dialog. This typically occurs when using Hey Siri or headphones. (92625281)

Siri will return an error when running an App Shortcut phrase that contains a parameter. App Shortcut phrases without parameters are unaffected. (96128292)

Workaround: Parameterized App Shortcuts can still be tested from the Shortcuts app.

Stage Manager

Known Issues
Stage Manager content might not display correctly when using resolutions lower than 4K. (91981726)

With Stage Manager enabled, app windows can receive unexpected touch events while typing on the software keyboard. (92645222)

Stocks

Known Issues
The Stocks watchlist widget incorrectly shows Watchlist Deleted, but the watchlist is present in the app. (93070133)

Workaround: Remove and re-add the widget.

StoreKit

New Features in iOS & iPadOS 16 beta 3
A property recentSubscriptionStartDate is included in RenewalInfo. It represents the date that marks the start of the most recent period of continuous subscription. A period is considered a continuous subscription if there is no more than a 60-day gap between any two subscribed periods. (86599570)

Resolved in iOS & iPadOS 16 beta 3
The recentSubscriptionStartDate is always Date.distantPast when using StoreKit Testing in Xcode. (93794298)

Deprecations
Deprecated the SKDownload API and removed the option to upload nonconsumable in-app purchase assets for Apple to host. In addition, support for managing these assets in App Store Connect is no longer available as of April 2022. (89764253)

Swift

Known Issues
Network.framework resolved an issue that could cause NWBrowser, NWConnection, NWConnectionGroup, NWEthernetChannel, NWListener, and NWPathMonitor to trigger a retain cycle when various Handler blocks are set. Starting with macOS 13, iOS 16, watchOS 9, and tvOS 16, if software using Network.framework targets these releases as the minimum OS, the object releases any blocks they captured once cancelled, breaking the retain cycle. (89677097)

Workaround: For software targeting older versions, the retain cycle can be broken by setting the handler blocks to nil after canceling the object.

App Intents might fail when they're compiled in a Release build. (93668260)

Workaround: Mark the type conforming to AppIntent as public.

SwiftUI

New Features in iOS & iPadOS 16 beta 3
Added View.scrollContentBackground, which permits customization of background colors for scrollable views like List. (45928055)

Added View.focusedObject(_:) and View.focusedSceneObject(_:) modifiers to be used in conjunction with the new @FocusedObject to allow an ObservableObject to be vended by the focused view or scene. (83637876)

Known Issues
Providing actions to a navigationTitle modifier has been deprecated. Use the toolbarTitleActions() modifier or ToolbarTitleActions type in a toolbar modifier instead. (93658035)

SwiftUI views log to the console [UIFocus] <typename> implements focusItemsInRect: - caching for linear focus movement is limited as long as this view is on screen. (93428139)

Pickers might appear empty and fail to update when the initial selection is bound to a value that doesn't correspond to a tag. (92282222)

Subitems in an OutlineGroup can display the layout incorrectly. (93248032)

A view-based NavigationLink in a List fails to update the visible selection of the list. (92193873)

Lists and tables might not clear their selection when exiting Edit Mode. (94093589)

Table headers on iPad might have an incorrect appearance. (92933472)

Workaround: Wrap the table rows in a Section.

Conditional views in columns of NavigationSplitView fail to update on some state changes. (91311311)

Workaround: Wrap the contents of the column in a ZStack.

Selection-driven, three-column NavigationSplitView sometimes fails to push when collapsed to a single column. (93673059)

Content in UIHostingController and UIHostingConfiguration can appear truncated in certain situations when sized to fit, especially when using multiline text. (93685283)

UIHostingConfiguration won't have a minSize applied by default when used in list cells, which may cause row heights to be too small. Additionally, the cell's layout margins are being added to the minSize, but minSize is intended to be inclusive of margins. (85233971)

Telephony

Known Issues
A single SIM device shows two lines under Settings > Cellular > Cellular Plans when the device has only one SIM. (93678756)

An iPad with cellular service doesn't activate over cellular during initial setup flow, after an erase install, or when the user performs Erase All Content and Settings from Settings > General. (93295742)

Users on iPhone 12,8 China SKU units can have no cellular data.

Workaround: Eject and re-insert the SIM. Click Update Now button on Cellular Plan Removed pop up. This removes the second non-functional cellular plan in Settings > Cellular Plan. (95174916)

On China SKU units, Per App Cellular Data switch for third party apps under Settings > Cellular UI is disabled, if user performs clean install and restore from back up. (95570535)

Workaround: Manually turn on the Per App Cellular Data switch to enable cellular data for third party apps.

Users may see incoming and outgoing calls failing if they convert their phone line from physical SIM to eSIM on the same device. (96261293)

UIKit

Known Issues
Attempting to set an orientation on UIDevice via setValue:forKey: isn't supported and no longer works. (93367651)

Keyboard shortcuts that are performable, but not discoverable in the keyboard shortcut menu (such as an empty title), aren't performable while the keyboard shortcut menu is present. (93858278)

Swift apps that reference UIContextMenuConfiguration and are compiled with the iOS 16 beta SDK crash on launch when run on a device running an older build. (93505538)

The overflow menu won't appear due to center items unless a customization identifier is set. (91628998)

Deprecations
[UIViewController shouldAutorotate] has been deprecated is no longer supported. [UIViewController attemptRotationToDeviceOrientation] has been deprecated and replaced with [UIViewController setNeedsUpdateOfSupportedInterfaceOrientations].

Workaround: Apps relying on shouldAutorotate should reflect their preferences using the view controllers supportedInterfaceOrientations. If the supported orientations change, use `-[UIViewController setNeedsUpdateOfSupportedInterface

Voicemail

Known Issues
Voicemail transcriptions aren't available. (93907701)

Voice Shortcuts

Known Issues
When asking Siri an App Shortcut phrase and the App Shortcut requires parameter confirmation, Siri responds with an error if the parameter isn't a String or Integer. (93267551)

Workaround: When writing your App Shortcut implementation, only request confirmation on String or Integer parameters. Don't request confirmation on non-Codable or scalar parameters.

Wallet

Known Issues
Automatic Payments are only supported on Visa and Discover payment networks. Mastercard and Amex aren't currently supported. (93337069)

Users who've disabled security settings on their Mac might not be able to add new cards to Apple Pay or use their existing cards. (91082752)

Workaround: Read and follow these instructions in If Apple Pay on your Mac is turned off because security settings were modified .

Wallpapers

Known Issues
You must be authenticated to switch Lock Screens on all devices. (92643569)

Home Screen previews might show black when Reduced Motion is enabled. (91926028)

Selecting complete black or white in the color picker for the color picker doesn't actually select black or white. (93447599)

Fixed: Snippets and other SwiftUI features of App Intents don't build with Mac Catalyst. (93373847)

Fixed: Focus Filters can't be deleted if the underlying app intent is renamed. (94235463)

Fixed: When SF symbols are used in a DisplayRepresentation, the symbols can appear blurry when rendered in Shortcuts and Focus Filters. (89722491)

Fixed: The EntityPropertyQuery QueryProperties key paths require you to specify the entity type name and don't support prefixing with $. (93793810)

Fixed: You can't define entity properties that are entities themselves because the @Property wrapper doesn't support AppEntity types. (94289141)

AVFoundation

HealthKit

New Features in iOS & iPadOS 16 beta
The HealthKit framework has a new Vision Prescription data type that allows developers and users to store prescription information received from eye care professionals. This feature includes a new set of HKSample subclasses that allow developers to encapsulate prescriptions for glasses and contact lenses. Users of iPhone can directly store their prescription information from the Health app as well. Because most regions require the actual prescription document to purchase glasses and contacts, this feature also allows the storage of attachment files in HealthKit. Due to the potential privacy concerns around sharing unintended additional details from the prescription, the HealthKit framework has a new authorization API to allow users to authorize prescriptions on a per-sample basis. See header documentation in HealthKit and watch the WWDC HealthKit session for more information. (82940646)

SwiftUI

New Features in iOS & iPadOS 16 beta
You can now place a TextField in an Alert by using alert modifiers that accept a ViewBuilder . (64819930)

For control, Section , or other views that have a Label , the ViewBuilder content now automatically arranges and styles multiple views as hierarchical elements, such as title and subtitle. If the label views are intended to be arranged horizontally rather than hierarchically, wrap the views within an HStack . (85184563)

A TextField supports multiline text. Use a Axis.vertical axis on a text field to allow rendering of multiple lines in contexts like forms, where text is expected to be short to medium length. For long-form text editing, continue to use a TextEditor . (51463718)

Navigation bars have new default behaviors. A navigation bar defaults to an inline title display mode, if no title is provided. If a title is provided, the default remains large. Use the navigationBarTitleDisplayMode(_:) modifier to change this. By default, a navigation bar only renders if it has content to display. If a navigation bar has no title, toolbar items, or search content, it's automatically hidden. Use the navigationBarHidden(_:) or the new .toolbar(.visible) modifier to explicitly show an empty navigation bar. (84996257)

A list supports Section footers. (78462739)

When the toolbar modifier is applied at multiple levels of a hierarchy, items from a child are appended to those from the parent that have the same placement. (65619097)

When using .windowResizability(.contentSize), windows created with SwiftUI set their resizable and fullscreen flags based on the size of their contents. (65791490)

List separator insets can now be customized using HorizontalEdge.leading and HorizontalEdge.trailing alignment guides. (74192080)

The implementation of list no longer uses UITableView . (81571203)

SwiftUI now enforces at runtime that view and view controller representables are value types. (82982458)

Symbol images now use an automatically determined symbol-rendering mode by default. To have a symbol image always use monochrome rendering, use the SymbolRenderingMode modifier. (85524479)

A Picker with a menu style in a list displays its label by default. To hide the label, use the labelsHidden() modifier. (88228016)

Pickers in list default to the menu style. (89186618)

Changes to text and image views now animate by default. Use .contentsTransition(.identity) to disable this behavior. (89558882)

Lists and forms automatically dismiss the software keyboard, if present, when a scroll gesture begins. Use .scrollDismissesKeyboard(.never) to restore the old behavior. (89588639)
