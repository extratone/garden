> Support for signing in to an account via URL scheme.

Absolutely delighted you all are continuing to invest in URL schemes! However... full documentation for 1Password’s URL scheme has been brought up a handful of times over the years and yet still continues to elude...

As far as I can tell, “[Add support for 1Password to your Mac app](https://support.1password.com/integration-mac/)” is close, but other users here and elsewhere have suggested that it’s not quite comprehensive in the past. I assume sign-in support included the addition of new a new command(s).

(Sorry to be a bugaboo - this is *not* unusual at all, unfortunately when it comes to URL scheme docs.)
