## Store App ID values and navigate to an app's Market Tools page from the share sheet.

![App Store to Market Tools Shortcut](https://i.snap.as/DxrXZqep.png)

I created this shortcut specifically because I regularly find myself hunting for a given app's [Marketing Tools](https://tools.applemediaservices.com/app-store) page, usually resorting to manually copying the appid from the App Store share URL and pasting it at the end of `https://tools.applemediaservices.com/app-store/app/`. With this shortcut, one can launch an app's Marketing Tools page *directly* from the share buttons in the App Store, all the while storing the URL for said page in both their Safari Reading List and a Data Jar dictionary specified at install (by default.) Obviously, these options should be configured as per individual preference.
