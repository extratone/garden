## Some development ideas I probably shouldn’t pursue:

1. I’ve been fantasizing about being the one to establish an integration between Typora and Snapas via Typora’s “[custom image uploader](https://support.typora.io/Upload-Image/#upload-automatically-when-insert-images)” option. 
2. A Siri Shortcut/library of Shortcut actions for interacting with the Snapas API in conjunction with the enhancements provided by [Toolbox Pro](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/toolbox-pro-review-a-must-have-companion-utility-for-shortcuts-power-users/).
3. A Drafts [Action](https://docs.getdrafts.com/actions/) and or [Action Group](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/action-groups) which utilizes both writeas and snapas API integrations to make publishing on iOS/MacOS _dangerously seemless_ for powerusers…

That’s the thing - working _around_ the limitations of this suite has demonstrably simplified my life (as I wrote about, unsolicited, in my reply to [this thread](https://discuss.write.as/t/add-pictures-to-email-publishing/2777/3).) Also, I am just hopeless when it comes to understanding APIs… 

If any other users would benefit substantially from the effort, I’d really like to know. And of course if any *real* developers would like to “steal” one, I would love & benefit from that lolE
