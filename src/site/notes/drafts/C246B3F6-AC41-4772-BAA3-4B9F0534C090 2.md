## Make lossless archive files from the share sheet as quickly as possible.

![T A R Shortcut](https://i.snap.as/JVhygsTh.png)

*Optional*: Alex Hay's cross-platform [**Logger app**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/logger-for-shortcuts/id1611554653), which is a wonderfully convenient means of storing direct URLS to one's archive files.*

I developed this shortcut for myself - specifically to call from the Share Sheet with multiple files selected, usually in the Files app. Though I suppose I've never technically verified it - as I understand it, anyway - `.tar` files are "lossless" archive files, and - though there are, of course, many many ways throughout the operating system(s) to turn selected files into *.zip* archives, I do not have anything large enough to warrant starting out with any form of compression.

The two most consequential actions are simply [Make Archive](https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/actions/make-archive/) and [Save File](https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/actions/save-file,) of course, and it's only noteworthy to point out that the shortcut comes configured by default to name the output archive files by [DavodTime](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/wiki/DavodTime).

Upon installation, you will be asked to specify (literally any) folder in which to place the output archive files. If you've opted in to using [Logger](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/logger-for-shortcuts/id1611554653) to keep track of your outputs, you might also want to take advantage of the second installation step, which simply prompts you to select a Logger tag for the messages.
