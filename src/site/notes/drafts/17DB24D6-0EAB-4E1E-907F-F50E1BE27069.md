Your vision has been clear regarding your significant relationships. This part of yourself will transform into something else. You will have to deal with your recent sense of lucidity replacing the way you articulate yourself. You have a gift for the big picture, but right now you need to pay attention to details and individuals. Sometimes being realistic destroys dreams, and sometimes it fertilizes them. Keep your eyes open. This transformative situation will see its beginnings in significant relationships. Keep an eye on how you relate to the people you're dating, your best friends, or people you work on projects with. This situation will alter how you think about the world, modify your day-to-day existence, and affect your subconscious. Recognize your lacks, think of ways to become better, shield off the more sensitive parts of yourself, and imitate the very things that intimidate you the most. Force yourself to pick sides. As a result of this situation, part of your personality will change and be replaced with something new.
