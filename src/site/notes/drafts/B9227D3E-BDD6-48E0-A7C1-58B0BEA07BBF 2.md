Howdy folks! I'm new here, and I realize it might be presumptutous to start a thread like this one as my first, but I wanted to both establish a place to continue related, ongoing updates as well as give a general heads up.

Using external keyboards with iPhone has sortof become "[my thing"](https://uikeycommand.com) over the past two years or so, but I've actively done so since support was first introduced. Having played a bit with the first two Developer Betas of iOS 16, I felt more comepelled to speak up regarding its potential impact for iPhone Keyboarders than I have for any other numbered release in memory.

Here's what I've documented initially:

- First, a single positive! It [appears](https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1533968485998534661) the Mission Control (Function-3) key will trigger the App Switching view, going forward.
- Unforunately, it appears that searching in the Files app will be exclusively relegated to the search view (triggered by Command + F.) As in, jumping to a file/directory alphabetically from the initial landing view by typing a few characters will no longer function.
- Spotlight is going to be a bit clunkier because of [its new view](https://i.snap.as/O86JlegI.png) (with the search bar pinned to the bottom of the screen.)
- Alterations to the context (two-finger-tap-summoned) menu have led to some generally unexpected cursor behavior in some apps when typing text.

If it's appropriate, I'd like to continue updating this thread (at a reasonably limited pace, of course,) as I find new developments. Of course, all feedback as to how I could make this thread/documentation elsewhere as helpful as possible as well as any additions are more than welcome.

Thanks for your time!
