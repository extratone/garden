okay, this is a recommendation/configuration question I should have asked here a few weeks ago, at least...

in my late poking around macOS for the first time in 10 years, I came across SnippetsLab recently and immediately fell quite smitten with it. unfortunately, though it does sync natively over iCloud, it does not do so in a way that is exposed on my iOS/Windows devices without me remembering to export a plain text and/or JSON version of the whole library every time I put the computer away... (I already have a repo set up and... have no had much luck yet in figuring out a way to make it coherent.)

I thought - before I continue to invest the inevitable time and energy to noodle my way into a solution that at least syncs over Git with a single shortcut trigger (like I did with Tot) - well... I was hoping somebody else might have solved this problem better than I will lol. 

I see so much praise for SnippetsLab from the mac folks, but none of the snippet management-adjacent-aspiring iOS/iPadOS apps I could find in my search have gone anywhere near the particular approach to snippets management it is fundamentally built around.

basically, I'm asking about **cross-platform snippets management**.
