Thank you for the detailed reply, Stephen. Is there anything I could do to help? I would send you my logs but I’m afraid TA actions are the only way I know of accessing them hehe. 

Send me a DM on Twitter if you’d like - I’m [@NeoYokel](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel). I’d suggest email but I’m still getting used to Spark hehe.

Here’s my system information for starters
**Handset**: iPhone 12 Pro Max
**OS**: 15.4 (19E5235a)

I’ll also get back on the Slack group.
