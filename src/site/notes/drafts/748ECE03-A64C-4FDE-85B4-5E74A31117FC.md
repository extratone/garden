==To throw in with the interested parties, I’m now an iPhone-only user who writes long articles and books with the Apple BT KB. Switching back and forth among iA Writer, Ulysses, and Drafts, I’ve just returned to Drafts because I’ve realized the best approach to choosing apps is parity for the iPhone.==



The worst difference of all between iOS and iPadOS is CMD-tab does not work on the phone. The ability to search references from the keyboard bar limits that frustration.



(Now if only I could remember how to do everything in Drafts. Wonder if a Take Control manual would sell. I should write one.)

Hello! I’m still not very good at these cold contacts so please forgive me if I get too verbose..

…*but*, **I am also an iPhone keyboarder**. in fact, I’ve spent virtually all of 2021 seeking to become the ultimate authority on the subject in the interest of producing *The Definitive Guide to iPhone and the Bluetooth Keyboard*. 

Your post is literally the first remotely recent proclamation of iPhone keyboarding I’ve come across that was *not from me* lol. (If you look at my profile on this forum, it is literally just me bothering Greg about it… Which I have been doing since Drafts 3????)

Anyway, all I’m really trying to do is consolidate documentation which Apple patently refuses to do. (See [this thread of mine in the Apple Developer Forums](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/685201) but only if you’d like to get activated lol.)

Ultimately, I just wanted to reach out and say hey! I would also like to express a sincere offer/request that you come to me first with issues/questions/bugs/general confusion on this subject. My whole life purpose has somehow entered orbit of this issue - helping people is my new drug, if you need to frame it as doing me a favor. 

If you’re curious, I have set up [a rather unsubstantial landing page on NeoCities](https://uikeycommand.neocities.org) and a [GitHub org](https://github.com/ExtraKeys) (which I’ve gotten behind in keeping parallel with my ever growing pile of docs.)

apologies for the wall of text! thank you for your time :)
