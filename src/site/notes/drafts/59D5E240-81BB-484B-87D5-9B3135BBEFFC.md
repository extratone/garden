**Automatic Daily Space Wallpapers from NASA**
So I have a use of Siri Shortcuts I’d like to share with you guys particularly because it’s one that we can (theoretically) just set up once as an automation and then never have to think about again.

[**This shortcut**](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/23f9214990314dacad6badf642791afb) retrieves the NASA image of the day and sets it as your wallpaper. Since automation notifications can be disabled, now, it doesn’t take long at all to set it to run every day at a certain time without disturbing or prompting you at all.

The process to set up the automation(after you’ve installed the shortcut) is:

Shortcuts app -> Automation tab -> + in the upper right -> Create Personal Automation -> Time of Day -> (Set your preferred time and interval) -> Add Action -> Search for and add “Run Shortcut” -> Tap on “Shortcut” -> Find “SpaceWall-DavodMod” -> run it once with the ▶︎ button in the lower right corner so you can approve it -> Next -> turn “Ask Before Running” off and approve -> and you’re done!
