who wanna guess how many times I ran this action since it broke before I realized what was happening? lol https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/represent-nothing-null-in-actions/12745

I've come to love and depend upon my [Clear Clipboard action](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1vP) as *the* single simplest/quickest way to clear my iPhone's system keyboard with a paired keyboard shortcut. It uses a single, empty clipboard action. Since either 32.0 or 32.1, however, it appears that empty templates are now automatically filled with `[draft]`. As you can imagine, this managed to confuse the heck out of me for an embarrassingly long time before I realized what was happening.

I appreciate looking out but - if I may - I think this change has major potential to cause confusion for others as well. My case is unusual, I'm sure, but I would imagine empty actions are something folks use regularly in action development.

And as far as I can tell... All the ways of doing this in JavaScript are overcomplicated, and unfortunately, `app.setClipboard()` returns "undefined."

Removed from public directory listing temporary (hopefully) due to an issue as of app version 32.0 or 32.1, as detailed in [this forum thread](https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/represent-nothing-null-in-actions/12745).
