please do not be another person who refuses to believe me when I say that most of (95+%) what's left of me is in my work but then continues to string me along insisting they''re going to find something else only to one day have an epiphany, turn to me, and say "wow you really don't give a shit about anything, do you?"

it's semi concerning that you are so unconcerned with it. not suggesting you have to enjoy it - CERTAINLY not suggesting that I need you to praise it - but it's like fundamentally really weird to me that someone would be interested in someone romantically but not at all interested in what they do. like, that's definitively casual shit. which is fine! but ya know. at this point I definitely cannot be casual with you lol. also weird to me that you are uninterested in reading something I continue to cite as extremely true about me. I get just wanting to talk and see what happens! that's where you're at and I want you to enjoy it. but I cannot invest 12 hours a day in being a diversion.

and when I say *weird*, I DO NOT mean wrong. I wish had it in me to just give anything a shot, ya know. I remember being 23 and feeling very curious and super ready to dive into anything. I just fuckin can not anymore.
