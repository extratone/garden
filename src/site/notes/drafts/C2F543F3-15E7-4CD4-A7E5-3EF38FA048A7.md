we run a private therapy practice out of her home and just a few minutes ago pulled the trigger on the biggest and most profound tech purchase of her life (1Tb wifi iPad Pro). 

she just turned 71 this year and has lived in MacOS forever, but I (the person entrusted with improving and maintaining her relationship with these things…)
I’m at *absolute zero* apprehension about my decision, even with the understanding that it will almost certainly be her last professional machine.

I’m going to express this at least somewhat more formally in public, too, but - in the moment - I want to make it known how much of this confidence comes from the thoughtful, precocious, pioneering, diligent, and now exceptionally well-honed work of Federico Viticci. 

(If anything goes wrong I’m immediately blaming it all on you lmao.)
