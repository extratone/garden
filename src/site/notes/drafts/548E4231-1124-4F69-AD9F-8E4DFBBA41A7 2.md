## Drafts Transcription

Regarding the iPad professional a lot of it like most of the tech writing about the iPad Pro and was general discourse including what's been for me has been about how to make the iPad do you want a Mac with you professionally personally etc. and in my experience with my mom well that's impossible really very is it it's very painful and I probably am just riding the high from using iPad Pro if you're using my iPhone as an iPad Pro for so long
===
Which is definitely something it out but I think I guess I've kind of gotten to the point with this iPad already and just a few weeks two weeks we are rather mean coming from the iPhone instead of like a bad supplement for macOS it's instead just iOS with zero hardware a limitation basically so experiencing this operating system that I've been using more than ever with anyone shit on iPhone we are just a witch being like if you're me if you're Federico this is great it's like it really is like I think
===
I would rather be using this than a Mac but that's only because I'm not on familiar with the bag that is an accomplishment I guess but I XCX like a clearly more Lucille the Mac stories issue in particular was just bringing that God I want to see joy don't think I felt right maybe I felt real joy briefly but if something when I could do split sex with time and dress brief read moments of very empty joy but otherwise I'm trying to bring that sense of power to others Mac users
===
I don't know it's not a deliver that I particularly feel like personally tackling I guess I don't like I guess I I thought that it would be for my mom I thought I I don't know what I thought I thought that the touch thing might resonate with her but just sort of like me it's doesn't really like the ones that like being able to touch the screen to read is and manipulate text is the one thing that really means a lot to me the rest of it is kind of pain and that's with the cursor it's great I think it says something that I just tanner but it says something that I feel are a tend to gravitate more toward using the trackpad the more tired I am
===
I don't I don't know from more touch native people "be coming from an I PO coming from an iPhone and iPhone with 60 Hz refresh display you know how long a limitation of the display I did not think the 120 thing would matter it definitely is it for sure if I delete it almost look going to the iPhone and make it because it's running I was 16 theater which includes all sorts of flickering but a literally I can see the flickering ass ridiculous that's something that can be either that would be ironed out with like a day of such a back right so I wouldn't notice anymore but I am god dammit you're that it's an apple me up I will do some of your positive thing for me if you look at it as iOS extended
===
It's great if you look at it as touch macOS it's horrendous and over complicated I don't know if that's not really insightful but I think I haven't really seen it put that way
