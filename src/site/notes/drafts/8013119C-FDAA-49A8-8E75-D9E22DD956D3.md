So, you’re new to Drafts and searching for a primer, eh? Well, this is only part of one, but I’d like to think it could be significantly more useful than most of the search engine results your eyes were just skimming. It’s list of links on the world wide web!... one that I personally know disturbingly well, now, (most of this was compiled off the top of my head which is *very* unusual, these days,) and of a particular sort: it’s the one I’d wish someone had shown me on day one or two (only I’ve enjoyed learning over the years so...)
