I love that we can now call x-callback-urls in Blink with `xcall` but I was wondering if we could expect further documentation on the options associated with the command.

When I run `xcall --help`, I get:

`Usage: xcall [ap:j:b:i:s:vh] url`

I appreciate the demonstration, but I havenâ€™t been able to figure out any of the options in the brackets.
