- [r/Shortcuts](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/tej1is/shortcuts_actions_are_coming_to_tot/)

I was delighted to discover by way of the macOS Beta that shortcuts actions are coming to [Tot](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tot/id1491071483) and [Tot Pocket](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tot-pocket/id1498235191)!

From the Tot version 1.3 Testflight notes:

> • Added support for Shortcuts:
> - Commands to get, set, or show text from any dot
> - Works great as scratchpad to collect input for a Shortcut
> - Also a convenient way to save text that has been processed
> - Same actions on macOS and iOS, allowing shared workflows
