- [r/shortcuts - Automatic link paste](https://reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/tt8ls7/automatic_link_paste/)

[Here’s a quick solution](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/878265cf3d5a422b85fec3dd40cb5678) using the `Tweet` action from [Aviary](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/aviary-for-twitter/id1522043420), but you could substitute any client with Shortcuts actions.

It makes use of the first of the two methods to “unroll” threads listed in [the app’s help page](https://threadreaderapp.com/help) and just Tweets `@threadreaderapp unroll [Tweet URL]`. I also set it to appear in the share sheet.
