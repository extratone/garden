  "\n\nA person was born in the early 1990s to parents who divorced quickly. This person's father had a farm and taught them about cars, tractors, and airplanes. They became interested in Japan and Japanese entertainment and video games. They went to school and then college. They now write about their experiences.",
  "\n\n\nIn 1994, the odds were against the author being born. They were born in the same year as the first class at their elementary school to be exposed to new Windows 98 PCs in the computer lab. The author was also lucky to be born to parents who divorced quickly, sparing them from any pain that could've resulted. The author was also lucky to have their own computer in their room at a young age. The author became interested in Japanese entertainment and video games, and started talking to a friend online who introduced them to gadget bloggers. The author's mother then bought them their own MacBook, and the author's lifestyle radically shifted. The author has written about the contrasts and discrepancies of consumer technology development as its progress has disconnected from the upward linear trajectory in use, quality, and genuine innovation for the End User in a departure which has been especially visible from my perspective as an academically-untrained, but intensely demanding user in the past five years.",
  "\n\nIncalculable odds were against the protagonist's arrival in this world happening in early 1994, which positioned their life to bridge the two species' most significant millenniums. They were the first in their class at Fairview Elementary to receive curriculum-mandated exposure to brand-new Windows 98 PCs in its brand-new, fluorescent-lit computer lab. The protagonist's generation was the first to have the available relief of air conditioning during the school day. They were home sick and watching the last television allowed in their mother’s living room as the second plane hit.\n\nThe protagonist's father experienced a variety of different technologies throughout his life. He would watch NBC, ABC, and CBS on a CRT TV, as well as form a business with friends cleaning out old abandoned barns. The protagonist was exposed to Japanese entertainment and video games, which was very different from their peers. They were proud of their technical knowledge and experience, which made them seem arrogant and elitist to others.\n\nThe protagonist started talking online with a friend, which led to them becoming obsessed with software, design, and gadgets. They would experiment with their own tech YouTube channels until high school. The general consumer technology narrative since Steve Jobs’ death has become increasingly more about the companies who design and sell hardware and software than about how and why their consumers actually use them.",
  "\n\nIncalculable odds were against my arrival in this world happening in early 1994, which would position my life within a timeline that would allow me to bridge my two species’ most significant millenniums in the first grade as a student in the first class at Fairview Elementary school to receive curriculum-mandated exposure to brand-new Windows 98 PCs in its brand-new, fluorescent-lit computer lab in the center core of its 50-year-old rectangular brick structure. The lab also meant that ours was the first Fairview class to have the available relief of air conditioning during the school day. It’s unlikely that I would be home sick and watching the last television ever allowed in my mother’s living room as the second plane hit.\n\nI was born in 1994, which was a significant year because it meant I would be one of the first students at my school to have access to new computers with air conditioning. I was also lucky because I was born into a family that owned a farm, which gave me the opportunity to learn about and experience different types of technology."
