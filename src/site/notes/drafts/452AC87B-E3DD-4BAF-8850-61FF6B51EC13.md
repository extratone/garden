Hello!

I’m reaching out because I’ve been testing Tot’s Siri Shortcuts actions on macOS and was wondering if they’re present in the current iOS test build, if there is one. (Unfortunately, yes, this means this email is essentially just solicitation for a Testflight link.) Tot’s become essential to me on both platforms lately as I’ve been using it as a sort of “[Dashboard](https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1486199217152569346)” for Drafts and Shortcuts via URL schemes, and I’ve actively been working on coming up with new ways to integrate it with other stuff (including [Drafts](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1uL) [actions](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1ub) and a [TextExpander snippet group](https://app.textexpander.com/public/4cef7d32b411c6686d50c7eaff75a7a7).)

Basically, I would love to also be an active participant in testing Tot Pocket, if you’ve got room.

Coolest shortcut title so far: *Hot Tot Dot Swap*

Thank you for your time!
