In the past year or so, my use of my iPhone 12 Pro Max as a "professional computer" has definitely been peaking. This lifestyle, combined with my discovery of [Tot Pocket](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tot-pocket/id1498235191), and catalyzed by a general frenzy around URL schemes have all managed to converge in what I believe to be my most innovative potential contribution to the apple-adjacent poweruser crowd yet by a long way.

I've come to use [schemed Shortcuts run links](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/run-a-shortcut-from-a-url-apd624386f42/ios) (which appear and function identically with hyperlinks in this context and a few others) clumped together in the header of [my first Dot](https://github.com/extratone/tot/blob/main/1.md) (page) in Tot as my primary method of calling shortcuts. I rely on a TextExpander snippet (which you can find among the hundreds of others in [my primary public Snippet Group](https://app.textexpander.com/public/14093096578d4f40eeea15649f5cefbb), if you're so inclined) to construct these links, one at a time. The format is detailed in the hyperlinked article from the official Siri Shortcuts guide, though I'd still like to lay out a single example.

Say I'd like to construct a markdown-formatted hyperlink to run my "[Speedy Frames](https://bilge.world/speedy-frames)" shortcut...

I'd begin by constructing this schemed URL, taking care to URL-encode the single espace:

`shortcuts://run-shortcut?name=Speedy%20Frames`

In most local, markdown-rendering contexts on iPadOS/iOS, this link can be treated as just another URL in hyperlinking terms:

`[Speedy Frames](shortcuts://run-shortcut?name=Speedy%20Frames)`

That's it! It is a few dozen of these individual links that make up the mess you see in Dot 1 displayed in plaintext mode (embedded below, left.) On the right is the view I look at and interact with.

Before I go on to the rest of that Dot's contents, I should note that I also occasionally call Siri Shortcuts (the ones with very short, single-word titles, especially) with my "[**Run Shortcut**](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1xP)" action, which makes use of the same link format to allow running Shortcuts directly by title, almost like a command line. This is best demonstrated by the Twitter video embedded below, I think.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">don’t know if I’ve already posted about it but...<br><br>this is one of the ways I’ve been calling Shortcuts recently - a <a href="https://twitter.com/draftsapp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@draftsapp</a> action that uses `shortcuts://run-shortcut?name=[selection]` with a keyboard shortcut. vaguely CLI-esque. <a href="https://t.co/aJE7j2tREe">https://t.co/aJE7j2tREe</a> <a href="https://t.co/r74iPY83ST">pic.twitter.com/r74iPY83ST</a></p>&mdash; ⓓⓐⓥⓘⓓ ⓑⓛⓤⓔ (@NeoYokel) <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1509942482842361856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 1, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Living entirely within Drafts' more-or-less chronologically-oriented paradigm for so long has probably altered some core interworkings of my thinking, generally, but doing so entirely on *iPhone* has led me to seek out other, inverse arrangements of individual drafts. I found phenomenal personal success in that endeavor at the beginning of this year, especially, and *all* of it has been singularly enabled by Drafts' support of x-callback-urls and URL schemes.

A draft's individual, UUID-enabled link can be retrieved with the [permalink] template tag ([recently updated from [draft_open_url]](https://hyp.is/HbEl3PNDEeyxMf8r2UvPcQ/docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/templates/drafts-templates.html)) and used to turn any value into a markdown-formatted hyperlink within an action. In my own "[**Copy Draft Link as MD link**](https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/1v5)" action, I used [safe_title]. Said action simply copies the current draft's open link to the system clipboard. I've assigned it to a keyboard shortcut
