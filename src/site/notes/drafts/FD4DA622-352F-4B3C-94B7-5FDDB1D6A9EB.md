## Social

I made a Siri Shortcut that retrieves Bible verses and speaks them aloud. Turns out, The Good Book has definitely Gone Digital lol. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/e52ff21ed07d4e88ab0fcce042fdc494

ascend to Coolest Cat of your Bible study group with my new Siri Shortcut. https://routinehub.co/shortcut/12335

## Retrieve and hear a specified Bible verse spoken aloud via bible-api.com.

This shortcut prompts one to enter book and chapter:verse via two [Ask for Input](https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/actions/ask-for-input/) actions. It uses the provided values to construct a bible-api.com url in the following format:

```
https://bible-api.com/[book]%20[chapter:verse]
```

The value for `text` in the response is copied to the clipboard, spoken aloud via Siri Voice 2, and then displayed via a [Show Result](https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/actions/show-result/) action.

## Variations

- [Bible API (KJV)](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/3af9eeef414c4879a8ec2297f33565c4)

well I'm just glad to hear you like it! the real hero is named Tim Morgan, who developed and maintained the API it draws from (gonna link that in just a sec.) 

turns out, it was *ridiculously* easy to change the translation. literally a matter seconds hehe. turns out, you just append `?translation=kjv` to the request URL. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/3af9eeef414c4879a8ec2297f33565c4

here's the API. I was so glad to find a whole set of biblical-adjacent, very 21st century internet tools one afternoon a few weeks ago. just thinking how much I would have absolutely slayed in bible study/lutheran school with stuff like this lmao. https://bible-api.com
