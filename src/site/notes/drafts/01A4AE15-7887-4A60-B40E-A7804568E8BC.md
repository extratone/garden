Its fleece was white as snow,  
And every where that Mary went  
The lamb was sure to go;  
He followed her to school one day —  
That was against the rule,  
It made the children laugh and play,  
To see a lamb at school.  

And so the Teacher turned him out,  
But still he lingered near,  
And waited patiently about,  
Till Mary did appear;  
And then he ran to her, and laid. 
His head upon her arm,  
As if he said — 'I’m not afraid —  
You’ll keep me from all harm.'

'What makes the lamb love Mary so?'  
The eager children smile —  
'O, Mary loves the lamb, you know,'  
The Teacher did reply; —  
'And you each gentle animal  
In confidence may bind,  
And make them follow at your call,  
If you are always kind.'
