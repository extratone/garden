> I created a pretty simple shortcut and its last step is to run a Drafts action to copy note to the clipboard the only issue is that after it opens a new blank note in drafts but I don't need it I need the text in my clipboard.
> Is there a way to make it work without opening Drafts in the end?

![Sneaky Retrieve Draft](https://i.snap.as/8qaNlFcD.png)

yes! especially if you're willing to be explicit about it by utilizing [the magic of UUIDs](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/automation/shortcuts#get-draft-by-uuid).

what I've done with [**this example shortcut**](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/8e0b05e9dc5a4bf090ba2a7611f30797) is actually customized the returned variable so that it specifically retrieves the whole contents of the Draft. if you wanted to automate it more, you'll probably end up needing to retrieve said contents via a plain old [Get Draft action](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/automation/shortcuts#get-draft).
