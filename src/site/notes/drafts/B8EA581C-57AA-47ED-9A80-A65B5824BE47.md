  > For the iPhone, the overarching theme is that they're finally letting it get complicated. The home screen starts simple, but it can be complex if you want it to and Apple's also finally putting different elements on top of other elements so you can see Siri on top of your current screen instead of taking over the whole screen.



- [ ] There is less to iOS 14 that's relevant to my life, personally, than any other release I remember, but that's okay.



- [ ] "[iOS 14 Hands-On Tour: Hidden Feature & Widgets!](https://youtu.be/z2wNLoS0-HU)" | Soldier Knows Best on YouTube



- [ ] I'm pretty sure I do not think widgets belong on mobile... Then again, do I really *believe in* widgets in *any* context?



### App Library



I’m not sure an alphabetized listing of all apps is really that useful. As iJustine mentioned in [episode 2 of her new podcast](https://anchor.fm/samebrain/episodes/WWDC-Rumors--PS5-hype-and-Animal-Crossing-efmf8f), *Same Brain*, I think most users would use drag-down and search before looking through the list. 



### iMessage



- [ ] I'm afraid the text conversation pinning feature doesn't really apply to someone like myself, who never messages anyone but my girlfriend and my mom.

- [ ] I thought you already could set a group message’s photo?



### Maps



- [ ] [My guide to Columbia Missouri](https://guides.apple.com/?ug=ChNDb2x1bWJpYSBFc3NlbnRpYWxzEg0Irk0Q9afRyfG15J1VEg4Irk0QjZS24KKtt%2FaIARINCK5NEM3DzPio6eW5bxINCK5NEIiv4bu1z92nCA%3D%3D).

- [ ] I thought you could already share your eta?  Maybe I was thinking of Waze. 



### CarPlay



- [ ] Wallpapers for CarPlay is one of those features that didn’t occur to me to want, but I did/do.

- [ ] Though my personal experience with CarPlay has been limited, I can definitely imagine more layout options (“Horizontal status bar”) will be useful in *fringe* use cases.
