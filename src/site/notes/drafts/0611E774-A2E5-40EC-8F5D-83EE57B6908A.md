In case I miss you, the workflow I use for 90% of my WebDAV activity involves Koder, ~~which is free~~ ||(oh… i had no idea it was paid. I guess it’s been a long time lol.)|| and OG, but … odd. Its interface isn’t exactly intuitive but I will literally do a live demo for ya if you’d like lol. https://apps.apple.com/us/app/koder-code-editor/id1447489375
