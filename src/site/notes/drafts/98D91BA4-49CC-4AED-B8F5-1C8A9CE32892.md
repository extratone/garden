So you know how commercial aviation this is like it's nice but limps look we'll save the Bloom parking lot we've already had the blimpers on this cast it needs my OC it's half blimp half dog and it's my furry lover don't it's in my don't do that don't do that man and lover that's also a dog Siri describe him like a horse is a horse pizza it's an honor and we had like for God OK what if we combined like some furry convention would like the Hindenburg to so like we get all these fairies like an airship it always freeze an airshow at the same time so proud of the greatest anime Nia made no for real

After children of the corn 30 we're doing for ease of Aamir shift freestyle no it's called furry zeppelin furry zeppelin would definitely get people coming to the theaters for one thing we know that there are multiple Zepplin class airships was there any further is it some as well now but some of them weren't built this is legitimate I do want to build the Zepplin to I wouldn't change a thing my kitty how I will fire myself with the iron cross and everything I want to see the iron cross over 20 or over 2015 the Williamsburg I wanna try to dock Zepplin to in Williamsburg with the iron cross on the side of it and Furrys peeking out the windows hell is just arrived I'm sure that the Venn diagram for interests and I are just a circle the rain diagram for it it's just know it's

It's like another static on the analog television there's no signal that's the van so we can is this a double future children of the corn 30 and then furry Zepplin the vent diagram is a triangle mirrors that is a really really about David like an hour like first hour. Nearest diagram first half hour how much exploitation second half hour Furrys on a Zepplin freeze on a wolf rooms for Tatian hasn't been used yet we need to ostentatious flotation and zeppelins would Tatian we can just mail them both and get these people in the movie theater what two things three things aired the Amish what they have to do with each other you have to come you're not find out what I articulated an actual argue there is a theme to children like 130 and I can tell you right now I cannot see a theme in furry Zepplin like I can probably figure it out I'm not pretentious but right as of this moment

I cannot write for a Zepplin but I got the plot for it so there's a there's a the Hindenburg nine it's supporting and there's a bunch of normal people on it and then there's some Furrys and it spreads the disease as the airship is trying to dock and it's like everything I have ever thought about like fuck in a dog great idea no it's not fucking a dog it's like how do you wanna like getting a dog certain fuck what if you were a dog and then we fire everything thinking like maybe I'm like secretly a rabbit and I want to shit in his diaper and in jerk off and then I was like oh yeah who is David Bridges it's just at the helm like 100 iron cross jingling on his jacket and I just zoomed into his face and he's like sweating just trying to land it so now just flying trying to land the plane

It's like above like the whole thing is like above Nebraska and they're all trying to shoot him down the end of the movie is the zeppelin gets shot down in like three diapers shit just rains all over a fucking my Tulsa I just the Oklahoma is off the map forever but we're gonna call it Tulsa Nebraska Tulsa's in Nebraska now just what's the biggest alternate universe or 1989 was sold by Taylor Swift everything turned out differently I just like the idea others so many German metals that I am like I'm just wearing German metals and I'm sweating just holding myself up at the helm of the zeppelin nine like people are slowly darling like Ferrigno as the crew are keeping art like fighting off a furry army on the airship where

Boy touching the disease but also to avoid being violently slaughtered by the fact is I think just like having to avoid getting in like a free diaper soon as like a much German off like World War I era German officer uniforms and people are running away from diapers in furry suits in an airship like resumes and on David's face on the side of his cheek just got splattered with blood and his copilot just has like a Lugar in his mouth oh my God say we can do use a pleasure serving call I don't I don't think we could do this actually because like we have to know some read me yeah we need the Zepplin first did I I so we suggested this like 20 episodes ago I want to start a Kickstarter to build the Zepplin to like someone working and I just like are you gonna make any safety alter KRI directions no I want to make a pizza delivery service with the zeppelin colds up a Roni pizza zapper Roni pizza I mean

Like OK let's just paint this picture because that is entertaining so no one here in this podcast no one listening has ever witnessed an airship docking but here's here's what it's like so there are tons of engines on an airship right and so when it when ones flying over even though it's not moving very fast you just hear like a buzzing sound like this I like tongue is like a beehive this imagine like we ordered pizza and then you just see this like like 3/4 of a mile long fucking airship coming toward you hey Siri giant or iron crossing like that yeah it's pieces here and then like you know docking a Zepplin obviously is not not easy considering what happened but yeah I mean I think this is a good idea we really found a niche that is not being catered too so maybe airborne pizza Strom out and shoot some gliders just just the pizza box well and I know they had a little they had scout planes they could launch off of their ships in World War I

On the Germans dead find me for a dick you know it was incredibly dangerous and that they actually could land too it was a hook that could catch them yeah now they were they they had some I mean it makes sense but you know you know from that from what I'm saying like that's not safe and then I will enroll the one this one British pilot went to reload is gun and need to the guns was was above the wings he grabbed it his knee like hit one of the petals and his plain did the loop he while he was holding onto just the gun and he did up up to get him self back and that's amazing I'm over one like roll or one AH was fucking Jackie is hell is this one way I can describe World War I out like if he Aircon that is Jenkee ass fuck so let's move onto what if we put Slim Thug on Zepplin I don't know I'm taking off down there
