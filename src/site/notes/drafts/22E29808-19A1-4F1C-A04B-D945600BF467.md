Hello Min folks! I haven’t been so excited to find out about a project’s Discord server launch in a long time! 

If I’m not mistaken, Min’s developers live in Missouri? Don’t want to make anyone uncomfortable, but I live in Columbia, MO, and would basically love the opportunity to frame it as …. not like “grass roots software,” or anything… idk. I guess I would like to think the fact that Min’s developmental priorities make so much more sense (for my own use, yes, but also for the average user’s) than any other web browser I’ve ever encountered might have something to do with its creators’ distance from the Wacky Fantasy World on the West Coast. 

anywho, I’m David Blue and I’ve put off writing about Min for far too long. very glad to be here.

I also wanted to say:

I’ve taken the opportunity provided by a membership discount to give 1Password a chance again (which is not going well, in case you were wondering lol,) so I took a sec to try out your integration with it last night… and my god… utterly genius. notably the most abstracted installation/integration with a CLI I’ve ever seen, generally, which is. incredible because it actually works!! (so far.) just makes everybody else’s insistence on using browser extensions to accomplish this look utterly daft lmao
