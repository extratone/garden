diversity of thought!!!  nope, there's simply no excuse lol. if "niche" authority like yours is not engaged with by the youtube-facing crowd in a very specific way, we remain distant from each other for no reason (it is the media professionals' job to reach out to and accommodate *you* as a technical authority.)

sorry, I have always been one of the media guys (I just haven't actually made money doing it in a very long time lol) and the way Apple-adjacent media behaves, specifically, just bothers/confuses the heck out of me.

btw I'm not even suggesting you are obligated to show up or anything... or that anybody's obligated to do anything. but like... I wish they'd have reached out. that's all I'm saying. I certainly hope Federico is keeping up with your shortcuts, at least!
