this freedom was one I valued very much and also didn't want to "lose," necessarily, despite recognizing how absurdly untenable it would immediately become if I ever lived in any other situation. I understood this *legally*, yes - back then, you could absolutely face legal consequences for screwing around with a firearm in any public setting (in Missouri) unless you were doing so for the purposes of *transporting* it, and had secured it so appropriately.
