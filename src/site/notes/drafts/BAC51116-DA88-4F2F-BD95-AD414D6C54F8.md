Matthew Cassinelli

@mattcassinelli

Welcome to issue 35 of ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs New in Shortcuts‚Äù ‚Äî the public betas are finally here and more of you can play around with the new Shortcuts features!That being said, I‚Äôve definitely run into some bugs that break my very-specific workflows, so I wouldn‚Äôt recommend installing everything unless you have backup devices.Otherwise, the betas are fairly stable, the new actions are ready to be used, and now‚Äôs the best time to dig into your Shortcuts workflows before the busy season ‚Äî my summer of Shortcuts is really just getting started‚Ä¶

üÜï Public beta goodness

The public betas for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS released on Monday, marking the first time the iOS 16-cycle features have been available to the general public.And with that comes a whole new set of actions for Shortcuts ‚Äî however, a subset of those are broken, so I shared a piece on iMore explaining all the ones that do work in the current betas:

iOS 16 public beta adds 46 new Shortcuts actions for Focus Filters, Background Removal, Parked CarsIn the first public beta of iOS 16, Shortcuts has a whole new set of actions to build with ‚Äî here‚Äôs what‚Äôs available (so far) in my iMore column.

With the public now out, I‚Äôve also shared a huge set of shortcuts‚Äî75 in total‚Äîthat work with all the new actions, now available for members in early access before the full release this fall.For this set, I went through every app, every action, and every parameter in those actions, making dedicated shortcuts for each of them.Basically, if App Shortcuts will generate an entire folder for third-party apps, then my, ahem, Matt Shortcuts are hand-generated entire folders for first-party actions from Apple ‚Äî get them here:

I‚Äôve also spent a good amount of time redesigning the Shortcuts Library page, which adds a section for these iOS 16 beta shortcuts, simplifies the overall navigation, and elevates folders to a higher level ‚Äî it‚Äôll always be a work-in-progress, so check it out and let me know if there‚Äôs anything that could be improved:

Also in the news, this Thursday I saw John Voorhees‚Äô post about Shortcuts‚Äô new Share Sheet option on the Mac‚Äîwhich I admittedly hadn‚Äôt noticed yet‚Äîthat lets you extract the shared content from the app as the Shortcut Input in your shortcuts.This is a great addition that was sorely missing last year, although it does Sherlock the ShareBot app:

Ventura Adds Shortcuts to Its Share Menu - MacStoriesWhen Shortcuts debuted on the Mac in Monterey, Apple added more ways to run an automation than anyone expected, but there was one big omission. Shortcuts wasn‚Äôt included in Monterey‚Äôs share menu. That was a big disappointment for anyone (like me) who has built a lot of shortcuts that rely on the share sheet on

Finally, Chris Lawley briefly covered the new actions and features in Shortcuts in his iPadOS 16 preview ‚Äî I‚Äôve linked to the specific chapter here so you can hear about those updates specifically (~1 minute 30 seconds of coverage):

Martin Heusser shared his piece about interacting with Microsoft Teams using their API and the Shortcuts app ‚Äî this is a great jumping-off point for any office worker whose business uses Teams for communication and wants to automate it:

Set your Teams Status to In a Call when using other Calling & Meeting Apps on iOS | Martin HeusserHello everybody. I try my best to blog about new and unique Microsoft Teams related stuff at least once a month. If you‚Äôre new to my stories, feel free to check out my previous articles here. Today‚Ä¶

David Blue shared this clever setup that involves a-Shell, a specific package library, and his included shortcut ‚Äî with it, you can type in plain-text versions of keyboard shortcuts and get a properly-formatted version ( like ‚Äúcommand option v‚Äù to get ‚åò + ‚å• + V):

Quick Key Command Formatting with ksc and Siri Shortcuts ‚Äî The PsalmsDuring the course of my iPhone Keyboarding project, I managed to discover ‚Äúa command line tool to document and describe keyboard shortc‚Ä¶

Kevin van Haren shared this great screenshot/shortcut that generates example versions for every option in the Format Date action ‚Äî I use the Custom option all the time but often forget, so this is definitely handy:

Kevin van Haaren@kvanh

If you ever wondered* "what the heck do all these date/time formats available in iOS even look like?" here you go:https://t.co/gg2EkniLfi

(*just me then?)

or just the results (long screenshot with shortcut & results): https://t.co/pR0QZx6dq26:22 AM - 14 Jul 2022

Zed also shared this great Shell Script shortcut that sets your Mac to Low Power Mode automatically ‚Äî this is a great script:

zed@zed1291

Would you like an easy way to toggle Low Power Mode on/off on your Mac (requires macOS Monterey)?

Unfortunately Apple doesn‚Äôt make this easy out-of-the box, but you can use a Shortcut pinned to the Menu Bar.

Take a look, then try it for yourself: https://t.co/Jy32uPTexs https://t.co/VJ7aOaIVz212:37 PM - 12 Jul 2022

üë• From the Community

I love this idea for breaking up long Alt Text designed to explain the contents of screenshots ‚Äî it splits text every 1000 characters to fit within the limit:

Vivian@muchnerve

@ iPhone/iPad/Mac users

i made a Shortcut that cleans up and then splits text every 1,000 characters without breaking any words :) i use it when i‚Äôm tweeting screenshots with lots of text, because Twitter‚Äôs alt text character limit is 1,000 per photo. https://t.co/ekFKCSMds610:52 AM - 11 Jul 2022

This shortcut from Lennart on Twitter does the calculation for Body Mass Index when you log your weight ‚Äî nice to have both options in one go:

Faber shared this shortcut for resizing windows using specific dimensions that you type in each time you run the shortcut ‚Äî in the thread he explains that he uses this for consistent screenshot sizes:

Faber+ says BLM ‚úäüèø@faber_plus

If anyone needs a Mac shortcut for resizing windows to specific dimensions, I made this and I‚Äôm kinda proud of it. https://t.co/4BGLLIydDH

8:30 AM - 13 Jul 2022

I like this shortcut for logging work shifts to the calendar and the explanation for it ‚Äî sometimes a shortcut still requires a little bit of manual work, but it‚Äôs still better than navigating around complex interfaces over and over again when you‚Äôre trying to solve a problem like this:

FruitStandFrustration@FruitStandVents

if you need a better way to add shifts to your calendar since workjam sucks, i made a shortcut to help add them. still have to enter dates&times yourself but it‚Äôs easier than adding them all in the calendar app. üìÖ https://t.co/cLWkQoAa7h

12:55 AM - 9 Jul 2022

This shortcut for Toyo generates a bibliography for an extremely specific International Electric Propulsion Conference that‚Äôs all about rockets ‚Äî I have no idea what that is, but the LaTeX offshoot BibText is interesting:

Toyo@toyofumi_ep

If you are a Mac user, I made a shortcut to generate a BibTex for your desired IEPC paper. You don't have to manually add all authors anymore.https://t.co/GjPw7tpXKo2:01 PM - 10 Jul 2022

üîé Shortcuts Spotlight

Scotty Jackson and his sweet Shortcuts setups

For folks who don‚Äôt know him, Scotty Jackson is a fantastic automator, the cohost of Nested Folders with Rosemary Orchard, and an all-around wonderful Canadian man ‚Äî this week I want to highlight some of his awesome work:

Earlier this week, I saw this great tweet from the HomeMade Automation account (makers of Signals for HomeKit) that shared Scotty‚Äôs Focus Mode setup:

HomeMade Automation@HomeMadeAuto

Awesome discussion on the Automators podcast about using colored lights as a signal to yourself that it‚Äôs time to change your focus - aided by Signals for HomeKit! ‚Å¶@automatorsfm‚Å© https://t.co/d25iRy0js7

Here‚Äôs the episode link where you can listen to the full discussion:

Scotty has also been publishing a great series of Rapid Logging shortcuts, both for Agenda and OmniFocus ‚Äî here‚Äôs those stories on his blog as well:

Day Automation: Agenda Daily Log ‚Äì HeyScottyJI thought it would be good to do a series about how I automate my days as a means of keeping myself on track and conserving energy. The first part of this is in how I set up my day using the Agenda‚Ä¶

Day Automation: Rapid Logging ‚Äì HeyScottyJWhen it comes to capturing things as they come in to my life, I love the notion of rapid logging as is done in the Bullet Journal Method.

Day Automation: Rapid Logging with OmniFocus ‚Äì HeyScottyJI shared my Rapid Log Shortcut for Agenda the other day, and it serves its purpose, but I am an OmniFocus user, and so really, my rapid logged tasks need to land there.
