I have another real simple Siri Shortcut for you. I think it could be useful especially for those of you in school!

This shortcut changes text you've copied to "Title Case" - as in, it capitalizes the first letter of the appropriate words you need for a title.

Ex. "i wish I knew what school of english apple's 'title case' uses" â‡¨ "I Wish I Knew What School of English Apple's 'Title Case' Uses"

To be clear, all you need to do is copy (or cut) the text you want capitalized, run this shortcut, and then paste the result. https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/be7659dff0894949aa8f702bab929801
