Do you know how to make an action to randomly open drafts from inbox space?

-------------------------

So there’s galtenberg’s “[Open Random Draft by Tag](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1GC)” in the Directory. I use a siri shortcut for this that’s currently configured specific to me. If you’re interested, though, I’d be glad to rework it to make it universal.

It’s actually a lot simpler than my original hehe. [Here’s what I came up with](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/4631589e04a94aa2a1599ebec9445ffa). I’m going to assume you’ve got less than 999 drafts in your library.
