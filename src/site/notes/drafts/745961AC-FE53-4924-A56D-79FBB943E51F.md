I am Floh Gro – a 28-year young software developer 👨‍💻 from South Germany 🇩🇪

In my free time I often go out to ride my mountain bike 🚲️ on local trails or do other sports 🏅. I like to travel 🧳 with our campervan 🚐 and I’m always open to grab a beer 🍺 in town. I love coffee ☕️ and pizza 🍕. 

During my studies I deep dived into the productivity topic and tried a lot of apps / techniques / methods to get my sh*t done. I always love to read tips / tricks in related topics (probably more than I should 😂).

I listen to various podcasts 🎙️ but love (loud) music 🎧️, too. I listen to many different genres from Hip-Hop to Dance / Electronics and Rap to Worship – totally depends on my current mood 🍄.
