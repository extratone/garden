actually sorta ended up going the other direction lol. 

the model number yielded virtually zero results but Velbon does still make tripods, apparently.

I did also shoot a single-take, extremely rough video I can link later if you'd like.

### Description

Be advised: I filmed this single-take, completely unrefined Video File in haste and didn't revise a single frame before publishing it, but I promise I actually take the subject more seriously than any human being ever has, so if you have actually managed to arrive upon this video living with the intent to suspend your phone in front of your face, please do reach out using the links at the bottom, *especially* if you feel yourself about to spend any significant cash on the endeavor. 

In order to work extensively on my iPhone 12 Pro Max with an external keyboard, I've found that *suspending the damn thing* in front of my face in such a way that allows for regular adjustment *restricted to one axis at a time*. 

My "setup" to accomplish this is nothing more than the remains of an absolutely despicable, Walmart-sourced "universal" automotive interior vent mount strapped to the mounting plate of a very worn, relentless filthy Velbon tripod. 

I fully intend to figure out a dedicated space for mounting methodologies/hardware for my iPhone keyboarding project, but for now, start with the GitHub org: https://github.com/ExtraKeys

 Here is Velbon's current lineup, assuming they are,  indeed, still alive: https://velbon.net/product/tripod.html
