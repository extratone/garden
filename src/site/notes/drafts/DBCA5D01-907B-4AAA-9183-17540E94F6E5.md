aaa. I love it when you guys talk about music apps for obvious reasons but I'm really kicking myself for not mentioning Stationhead when I first discovered it the other day. it's an Apple Music client (works with Spotify too, apparently) that lets you "DJ" a live stream to anyone else who can auth with Apple Music either in the app or in a web browser.

I was super skeptical of such a thing actually working but I spent far too long playing around with listening and broadcasting and it works great! hilariously, the community seems to have been taken over with K-Pop fans, so I had the opportunity to get thoroughly saturated with that for the first time. it was a lot of fun.

also - I think I must have forgotten to post this, here, somehow, but the Pride mixes are out! Doss has like... unlimited energy with this one lol. https://music.apple.com/us/album/pride-2022-dj-mix/1626566476
