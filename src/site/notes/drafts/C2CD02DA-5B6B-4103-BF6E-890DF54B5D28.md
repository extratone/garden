## Grammarly vs. Drafts as GoTo Text Composition for Mom

Does anybody have any experience with **the Grammarly app on iOS/iPadOS**? As in, regular use/maybe even going there first to compose text sortof like Drafts’ original usecase.

I’m asking because I’m two days away from moving my 70 year old mother’s day-to-day workflow from MacOS to a brand new iPad Pro and would love to take advantage of family sharing + my Drafts subscription and insist that she start there, but I’ve noticed that she naturally goes to Grammarly to compose text, which I have absolutely zero experience with.

Grammarly has a keyboard for iOS that works at the system level. See if that works in place of the iOS app. Grammarly isn't a text editor, and it has saved me many times from basics writing errors. Their editing environment is unique. it's all about grammar, tone, etc. However, on Mac, they have plugins for MS Word and Google Docs that provide their complete feature set. The iOS app gets close, and the keyboard works for me for small batches of text. I guess your mom’s preference will depend on what she's writing or his she likes to write.

## Printing Calendar Day View

oh jeez… sorry guys I know it’s 4:30 on a Monday morning but another *converting mom to iPad Pro* obstacle just came to mind. 

specifically, my mom is a private practicing therapist and she runs all of her scheduling through Apple Calendar. every morning since the beginning of time, she prints the default Today view from the Calendar app in MacOS… and poking around on my iPhone just now, I can’t find an iOS equivalent workflow. 

and Google search results so far are uh… sus.

this is one of her things I’ve always wanted to automate so I’m assuming I’ll end up making a fairly simple Shortcut with native Calendar actions…. might have to finally learn how to properly use `Repeat With` lol

to be specific, I guess I’m asking if I’m missing something, or if an equivalently similar workflow to print Apple Calendar’s Today view exists on iPadOS.

> Oh wow, I had no idea Calendar's Print mode on the Mac was so pretty. Yeah I don't think the iPad app has anything equivalent to this, but maybe you can try with some third-party apps?

> I couldn’t resist taking a crack at this. Here’s a shortcut that will grab today’s events, format them into a table, and open up the print dialog on iPad. It doesn’t have the same layout as the Mac’s Calendar app, but I think it’s at least serviceable. And you can, of course, tweak the information in the file and the CSS to get it to look the way you want it to. I hope this helps!

I’ve found the whole process fascinating - I managed to sneak Shortcuts/Automations on her 12 Pro Max that automatically back up Contacts/Calendars weekly into a shared folder a few months ago. haven’t touched them since and they’re still working. and she doesn’t seem to have noticed…

my biggest hurdle is convincing her to let me automate the morning reminder text messages she types out in iMessage every morning… client-by-client… but in the syntax of a text bot (“You have an appointment with __ today at 3 PM. Respond YES to confirm your appointment.”) I’ve been begging her to let me make a Shortcut or at least *templatize* the process for years, now…

(sorry for the spam just one more anecdote:)
what continues to astonish me is how much better Apple’s native, *not-professional* suite has been at doing the stuff I need to do than 365 Enterprise was. (we switched practice management software and no longer have to handle HIPAA-compliant storage ourselves anymore.) in so many day-to-day usecases, Pages and Numbers outperform Word and Excel by crazy, shameful margins. I do miss Outlook, though, and those invites to 365 Admin events, which is truly sad lol. 

I think Apple Business Essentials could be a big upcoming story next year.
