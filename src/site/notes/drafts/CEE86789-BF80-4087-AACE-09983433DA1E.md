## Save a .txt file of all URLs present in the active Safari tab.

![Gopher Disc](https://i.snap.as/hVgy722l.png)

*Note: this shortcut is macOS-only*

This shortcut uses the default placeholder JavaScript in the [Run JavaScript on page](https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/shortcuts/run-javascript-on-page/) action to gather all the URLs present on the active Safari page. It then combines all the URLs into a single list, copies the result to the clipboard, and saves it as a .txt file named by timestamp in a folder specified at install.

It's named after [the Link Gopher browser extension](https://sites.google.com/site/linkgopher/).
