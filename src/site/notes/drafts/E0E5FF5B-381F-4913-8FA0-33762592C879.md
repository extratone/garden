Apparently I’m one day late with this announcement but iOS 15.2 is out! Some pretty major additions (that were supposed to come in 15.) I think MacRumors’ overview is more succinct than anything I could produce. https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-15-2-features

Way back when I recorded a demo of setting Legacy Contacts with Abby as my example. Even printed out and scanned the result. If you guys would like me to dig that video/scan out, please let me know.
