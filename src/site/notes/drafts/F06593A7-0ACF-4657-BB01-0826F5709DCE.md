Hey guys, I actually have a time sensitive and quite consequential hardware/setup question.

My girlfriend is a third grade teacher at a public elementary school here in mid-Missouri, and her 2023 school year is going to start in 8 days.

||I'm going to assume you're all smarter/more observant than me, but... I am ashamed to confess that I had *absolutely no idea* just how integrated iPads have become in elementary school education in an extremely consequential way. The past week has been... Extremely alarming, but that's not relevant to my question sorry.||

Each of her 25 children will be getting a 32GB, fifth-generation iPad (`iPad6,11`) that they sometimes take home I guess? But she will be responsible for storing, dispensing, charging, and regularly transporting (as in, between classroom and the "media center") all of them.

I have been asked to address the issue of storing and transporting them, specifically, and I thought the challenge might be a potentially enjoyable one to engage with. I've attached a single example of what another teacher has come up with (as well as an image of one of the half dozen or so?? piles of devices ||(none of which have been updated beyond 15.1 yet!!!!)|| to give you some idea of the scale of what these teachers are dealing with.)

Thanks in advance for your time. I uh.... need assistance lmao.

> Any cart solution is pricey sadly, [30 unit charging cart](https://www.amazon.com/LocknCharge-Joey-30-Cart/dp/B07PHGPYMZ) is nearly $1000USD.
> There are a lot cheaper optiions, just need to have enough chargers ðŸ˜„

> My middle school used a cart with wheels that could both charge and transport about 30 iPads at a time

> From my experience you have to use a proper cart. And it will cost 4 figures. Seems a bit odd whoever purchased all the iPads at the school administration level hasnâ€™t budgeted for a cart per class too! Cart seems expensive until screens start getting smashed moving from one room to another without suitable solution!!
