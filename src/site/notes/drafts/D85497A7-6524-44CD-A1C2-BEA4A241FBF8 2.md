SO... Somehow I am just now discovering the "unofficial" RoutineHub API (https://github.com/alombi/rh-api) and I was noodling around with my first shortcut last night, focusing on storing the profile data of specific RoutineHub users I'd like to keep up with. I can certainly describe it in detail for anyone who'd wish to hear about it directly, but it's probably easiest to just take a look for yourself.

Very adjacent but this shortcut also adds the user data to a shared Numbers spreadsheet I just started.
