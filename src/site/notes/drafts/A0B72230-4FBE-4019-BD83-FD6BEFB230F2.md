hey Carlos! I was hoping you and/or Gabriel might able to actually get something out of the MacStories giveaway I just won, which I didn't actually mean to enter lol.

it's a year's subscription to an iOS/iPadOS app called GameTrack.

https://gametrack.app

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gametrack/id1136800740

I'm going to send the actual code by itself as the last message in this string...
 
but I thought I might as well include the (almost certainly incorrect lol) instructions from the email:

"Open the Mac App Store, download the free version of the app, and then use the redeem button at the bottom of the Today tab to get 1-year subscription to the app."
