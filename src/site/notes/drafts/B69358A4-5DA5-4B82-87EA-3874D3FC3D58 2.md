Mo.K | 2020-04-18 21:53:03 UTC | #1

Just wanted to introduce a project I have been working on. It is called Fig, and it is native Discourse client for iOS/iPadOS.

Fig is available for [free](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fig-for-discourse/id1485491193?ls=1) on the App Store.

[![Screen Shot 2020-04-14 at 8.02.48 AM|690x234, 30%](upload://p41vZf26r6JR0fzMsQHH0wpR2y1.png)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fig-for-discourse/id1485491193?ls=1) 

Most of the functions and features in Fig are free and will be plentiful for most users. Fig+ subscription allows access to private communities, unlimited number of posts and communities, free app icons, and future premium features. It will also help sustain the continuous development of Fig.

Lastly, if you are interested in a while label version of Fig (SDK) for your own (single) community use, let me know. I am trying to gauge what the appetite is for something like this.

Happy Browsing. üòÉ

How is your freemium offering any different from Discourse's completely free, unlimited app that is already out there, namely Discourse Hub?

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/discourse-hub/id1173672076

I am not saying that your offering is bad, but it looks like you are copying Discourse's completely free iOS app that already "allows access to private communities" and "unlimited number of posts and communities" and charging for those features.

-------------------------

Mo.K | 2020-04-17 14:03:32 UTC | #3

Fig is a native client, and native is tech-lingo to indicate the software is made with the OS's default (aka native) software modal.

To illustrate the difference using an example, think about the difference of using www.facebook.com in your browser vs say the Facebook app in the App Store.

-------------------------

Hifihedgehog | 2020-04-17 14:16:55 UTC | #4

Thanks for taking my scrutiny very well. :) Being native can be a double-edged sword because many communities use specialized plugins in their Discourse forums. For example, if the app is fully native, then things like [Retort](https://meta.discourse.org/t/retort-a-reaction-style-plugin-for-discourse/35903), [Question Answer](https://meta.discourse.org/t/question-answer-plugin/56032), [Events](https://meta.discourse.org/t/events-plugin/69776), [Location](https://meta.discourse.org/t/locations-plugin/69742), and dozens of other plugins might not be accessible in this app unless you specifically coded for them. Don't take me wrong: I can see the value in your app being native but I am naturally quite skeptical when a freemium app like yours comes along when a completely free offering has already been available.

It's a real shame that private communities aren't supported in the free app. Meta might be the only public discourse community that I access with any regularity.

![image|345x211](upload://6BJ0eBO03h9LYFE3cg5yjJ7V6tZ.jpeg)

Do you plan to offer a free trial in the future?

-------------------------

Paracelsus | 2020-04-17 18:14:57 UTC | #9

Very nice app! 

Things I would like to see:
- a way to browse to last/first post in the topic
- number or some hint of unread posts for each topic in topiclist (like on discourse)
- a ‚Äútimeline‚Äù feature like tapatalk, meaning a list with an excerpt of most recent post for each topic (sorted by activity).

It is really not that simple and requires non-trivial amount of work. I have a prototype of it but no where near ready for prime-time and we will be targeting more important features at this moment.

To extend on what I said earlier, are you referring to the improved version of mouse support (with all of that button snapping stuff) in iPadOS 13.4 and onward?

---
I have some suggestions.
1. When previewing a community, it always defaults to top topics. Wouldn't it make more sense for it to default to latest topics so it doesn't confuse new users into thinking the community is completely dead?
2. The developer category in discovery should be changed to "Developer & Technology" or something like that, largely due to the fact that it appears that technology related communities (some of which are geared towards enthusiasts and consumers and the like) are thrown into the developer category.

Also, is there a way to submit a community to be added to discovery? Are private communities allowed in discovery?

-------------------------

Paracelsus | 2020-04-18 19:34:28 UTC | #14

One more feature I would like to see added:
- make avatar clickable to access user card (to send a direct message, for instance).

Not at this time. It is hard to enforce "1". Communities sync across devices, there is delay. Payment is synced across devices, etc. People login/logout to bypass it, add/delete community, etc.

1. Top topics do seem more attractive to new users who are browsing around. The issue you mentioned was brought up to me and I think the middle ground is probably the Top filter but also select the "Last month" filter as well.
2. Fair. Categorizing communities is hard and murky. :smile:

Yes, contact us in the support email noted in the Fig app's Settings. Private communities do not show up yet but will appear soon in search results later this week hopefully.

I noticed that the buttons to interact with a post (like, share, etc) are sometimes squashed a bit. Oh, and the way you check to see who liked a post feels slightly inconvenient and slightly lackluster. It isn't half bad though.

Also, how do you remove a community from your communities list?

-------------------------

Mo.K | 2020-04-19 01:42:53 UTC | #17

To quickly see who liked a post, tap and hold the like image or like/heart number label for a second and a window will appear showing you who liked a post.

To delete a community, go to the list view showing all your communities and swipe from right to left on that community and confirm deletion.

Regarding the UI bug with squashed buttons, send me a screenshot to our support email or post it to our community and will look in to it.

Maybe take a look at [introductory offers](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/in-app_purchase/subscriptions_and_offers/implementing_introductory_offers_in_your_app) on the apple developer site. Reasonably straightforward to implement and impossible to bypass without creating a new Apple ID.

It feels like there is wasted space. If there is a very large amount of likes on a post, the list view becomes inconvenient (lots of scrolling). You could probably fit a lot more people on a line.

This is great, thank you so much! I wanted to have a native app since I discovered Discourse and have used the DiscourseHub so far for lack of a better alternative. 

I don‚Äôt care if it doesn‚Äôt support all the custom extensions. I‚Äôll simply use it for the communities where it does work and will fall back to the Web/Discourse Hub for the others, if necessary. 

Since reading your post an hour ago, I‚Äôve already downloaded Fig (and use it to write this post), added all my communities to it, discovered three more communities that are interesting to me via the Discover tab and bought the yearly subscription. And I‚Äôd have done so even if I didn‚Äôt have a private community, simply as a thank you for developing this app. It‚Äôs just so much better than Discourse Hub and really feels like a modern reinterpretation of Discourse for iOS and a great iOS citizen. 

I‚Äôm looking forward for all the things you are still working on and for discovering many more niceties while using it.

I‚Äôll also check out the Fig Discourse community to see how I can help out in developing this app further.

Hello, first I want to say that I love your APP. 

Secound, when I am on the Topics Tab and I press the Topics Tab again the App just closes. This happens only in Portrait Mode on an Ipad Pro with the iOS 14.8 Beta. So it could be a Beta Problem but I think it might be interesting for you to know. 

And one Request that was the reason I was looking for an app for reading the Discourse Forums. I am searching for a way to see all my tracked topics, not just the unread ones. I cannot find a way to do this. 

Thanks for your great work.

Around the time of that reply's submission, it had been nearly two months since somebody had posted something.

Does the developer read this topic? I love his application, but there's a bug that I desperately need help with.

I was wondering if it is possible to get a license to have my Discourse community on the app store as a standalone app? I believe many people would be interested in that.

You don‚Äôt need a license. There are several communities that have standalone apps on the AppStore

May I know how is it possible to create a standalone app connected to my discourse community?

Yes, there are ways to do it for free. Fig probably isn't what you're looking for though.
