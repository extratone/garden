second, Paste….

Copied was my clipboard manager on iOS/Mac for as long as I can remember, but - after having corresponded with its creator, Kevin - I can confirm that there is no hope of it getting back on the app store.

I think I can confidently say that I have every available clipboard manager for iOS on my iPhone currently. after having accidentally bought a year’s subscription to Paste, I’m glad I did, because it’s basically the closest thing to Copied available. also, its tray on MacOS is absolutely **gorgeous**. 

not as robust as Copied was, but that’s not particularly relevant unless you’re as hard on apps as I am
