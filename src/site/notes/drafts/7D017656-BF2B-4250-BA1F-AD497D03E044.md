I may just be a complete idiot but...

I'm working on a combo automator workflow + shortcut to extract markdown from Safari web pages and save it in Drafts (since `Safari Reader` is still broken in Shortcuts on macOS,) and I'm encountering a certain two lines of text at the beginning of the results which I'd like to remove:
```
Skip to content
Main Navigation
```
and for the life of me, I can't figure out how lol.

to say it another way: how would I go about removing specific text from text in Shortcuts?
