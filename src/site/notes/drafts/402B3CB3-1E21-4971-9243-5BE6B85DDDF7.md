Hi I wanted to know if you could help me create a shortcut to send a message to a telegram group every 1 hour

===

Unfortunately, that’s not gonna be possible. The native action doesn’t support sending to groups. If you wanted to send a message to yourself or another phone number-based contact every hour, you could do so, but it’d be pretty tedious.
