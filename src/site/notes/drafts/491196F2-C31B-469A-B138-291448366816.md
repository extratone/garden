Well thank you so much for being the one to tell me. Readdle is also going through a lot right now it sounds like :/

Something I have been thinking about for years, now....

**What if *Flexibits* built an Email client** :open_mouth: 

Sure Cardhop definitely needs some attention (but we have to remember it's fundamentally built atop .VCF - a standard which has not been *officially* extended since like 2011 that uses *inline Base64 text* to store contact photos lmao.)

Fantastical is just incredible though (still largely dependent on the same format.)

I know everybody thinks they don't actually want "all that much" from their email client but I promise I don't.

Basically, if Mail could competently save in *any* format on iOS/iPadOS, I would be content with it. lol
