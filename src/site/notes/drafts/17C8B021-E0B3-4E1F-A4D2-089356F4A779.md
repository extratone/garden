Hey Ray,

I saw your [Tweet](https://twitter.com/raywongy/status/1544317477697495045) calling for freelancers to write on the Guides vertical for *Input* and think I could offer some real value in that regard. I've responded to such requests before from *The Outline*, but obviously it's been a while. I've been writing guides-ish stuff [on my own blog](https://bilge.world/tag:software) - largely centered around iOS - for the past two years, especially, but would love the opportunity to work under my favorite handset reviewer (not actually kissing ass - just a fact) for perhaps my favorite digital media company in 2022.

The experience I have to cite comes with a particular addendum: it's been a long time since I've published under an actual masthead (not worth dredging up,) but - with a wee bit of editorial guidance, if you can spare it - I believe myself up to performing. If you take the time to read what I'm about to cite, please keep this in mind regarding my tone.

 [Speedy Frames](https://bilge.world/speedy-frames) might be a good one to start with because it explains how I create mocked up screenshots so prolifically, locally, and - notably - using only native iOS processes locally. I've also recently written about [Text Replacement](https://bilge.world/text-replacement) and [Blink Shell](https://bilge.world/tildetown-iphone-blink-shell). If those intrigue you, you might find it actually worth your time to just visit the aforelinked [software tag](https://bilge.world/tag:software) on my blog. 

Obviously, I'd love to hear back from you. Thanks so much for your time!
