no! please don't think it was/is anything about you or that you've done, and please accept my sincere apologies. I don't know if an explanation really matters to you, but at first it was mostly because the Meagan thing really fucked me up. I was super toxic and an asshole for years. now, I'm just finding my social energy lacking big time, if that makes sense. also deleted Facebook's app(s) from my phone last year. I am so sorry if wondering about this has caused you pain.
