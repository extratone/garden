|:-----------:|:------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `.nominal`  | Your phone is cooler than you are. Burn.                     |
| `.fair`     | Your device is warm but performance is probably not being throttled. |
| `.serious`  | Your device is hot and performance is probably throttled.    |
| `.critical` | Your device hurts to hold in places and performance is definitely being throttled. |
