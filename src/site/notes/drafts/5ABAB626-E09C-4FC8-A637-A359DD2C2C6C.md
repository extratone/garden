> A fursona is a personalized animal character created by someone in the furry fandom. The term fursona is a portmanteau furry and persona. The vast majority of furries have fursonas; the Anthropomorphic Research Project states that nearly every furry has a fursona, and The New Science of Narcissism estimates the amount at 95%. The Anthropomorphic Research Project additionally states that the average furry has 2.12 fursonas over the course of their life.Fursonas may be anthropomorphic personas, idealized versions of their owners, fleshed out roleplay characters, or simply digital mascots. A small minority of furries express a desire to become, or already see themselves as, their fursona's species. These people may additionally identify as therians or otherkin.Individuals' fursonas are acted out primarily online, but also at furry conventions and in other public spaces. Acting out one's fursona in person may involve wearing a fursuit.
