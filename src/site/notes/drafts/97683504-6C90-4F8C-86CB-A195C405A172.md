Enpass is not open source, but it *is* cross platform as all heck, far more frugal than the competition, and frankly FAR more intelligent to actually use day-to-day by way of … leaving in the buttons.

believe it or not, I had the opportunity to bring this up with at least one of the OG agilebits guys on their Twitter Spaces event for the launch of 1Password 8 just a few days ago and recorded my little bit evangelizing Enpass.
