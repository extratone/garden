## Openings

### “General Consultation”
- [Openings URL](https://fantastical.app/davidblue/general-consultation)

The Way We Use Our Computers is both more important than most of us are used to acknowledging and probably *less* important than those from whom we seek guidance on the subject end up realizing. I am 100% exempt from both of these blind spots and genuinely believe I have at least one significant contribution to make to the computing lives of just about anyone. For details, please see https://davidblue.wtf/services.

### General Impugning
- [Scheduling URL](https://fantastical.app/davidblue/annihilate)

Finding yourself desiring the opportunity to absolutely *lay into* a skinny, white, late-20s, vaguely tech bro-ish face, lately? Well, please let me lend you one! I have adequate experience in implicitly fulfilling the role of scapegoat, professionally, and can offer a 110% guaranteed NO CONSEQUENCES target (and the necessary context for such a thing.) https://fantastical.app/davidblue/annihilate
