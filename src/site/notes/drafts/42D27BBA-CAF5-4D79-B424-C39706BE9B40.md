As I wrote in my lengthy, somewhat sentimental, self-reflective review of Tweetbot 6, this app is the best way to experience Twitter in 2021.

It’s the most reliable Twitter client:

> …both Tweetbot 6 and Tweetbot 5 have been demonstrably more reliable for me in the past few months than Twitter’s native app, which has been crashing multiple times per day on my devices for quite a while during regular use.

Why? Here’s a quote from developer Paul Haddad:
> We’re definitely slow. We go over every screen, every detail over and over again until we get it right.

_Every screen, every detail over and over again_. Honestly - while I could just be unduly loyal, at this point - not only is Tweebot worth the price, it’s a _privilege_to use such a considered piece of software at that price. If you regularly use Twitter, you’d be silly not to pay up right now.
