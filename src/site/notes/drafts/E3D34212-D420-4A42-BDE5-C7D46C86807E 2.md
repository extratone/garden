I have the setting enabled to show keyboard shortcuts on my iPad (which has an external keyboard attached)

When I manually click an action, I see a progress spinner – it nicely moves over the keyboard shortcut text

But when I type the actual keyboard shortcut on my external keyboard, the progress spinner doesn't show – so I'm not sure that I've triggered the action correctly

Would be great to see the spinner in the case of triggering the action via keyboard shortcut

Thanks!
