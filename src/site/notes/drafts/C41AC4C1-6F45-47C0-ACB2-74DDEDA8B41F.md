## dinkus


> In typography, a dinkus is a typographic symbol which often consists of three spaced asterisks in a horizontal row, i.e.   ∗ ∗ ∗  . The symbol has a variety of uses, and it usually denotes an intentional omission or a logical "break" of varying degree in a written work. This latter use is similar to a subsection, and it indicates to the reader that the subsequent text should be re-contextualized. When used this way, the dinkus typically appears centrally aligned on a line of its own with vertical spacing before and after the symbol. The dinkus has been in use in various forms since c. 1850. Historically, the dinkus was often represented as an asterism, ⁂, though this use has fallen out of favor and is now nearly obsolete.

<u>Adjective</u>

*(Of an individual, project, social dynamic, single event, etc.)*

**Less present in popular discourse than is contextually appropriate.**
