For some reason, I have only recently begun to have problems with accidentally hitting the `Pin to Profile` button on (notably) shortcuts that *are not mine* as of this year. As far as I'm aware, it hasn't moved in that time, so I very well may just be getting clumsy lol. But accidentally pinning the wrong shortcut to my profile trying to hit the `Get Shortcut` button has somehow become a daily occurrence. If there's any way it could be moved or rethought... that'd help me tremendously.
