Hey everyone! Got another Panda iOS release for you today, and for this one we focused on two large features: OCR for images and PDFs, and big improvements to the new iOS on-screen keyboards for both iPhone and especially iPad.

**iOS 16 beta testers, please note**: The Apple betas are a little rougher this year with lots of big changes from Apple, and we've already seen some weirdness with Panda on it. We usually don't tackle these beta-OS-related bugs until the OS settles down later into the cycle. If you're testing iOS 16 and report a Panda bug, please remember to note that you're on the OS beta.

## What's new in this release:

- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** - Search text inside images and PDFs! A photo may say a thousand words, and now you can search through every one
- **The all-new iPhone and iPad keyboards** have received a lot of polish and love, and plenty of bug fixes. Please bang on these as much as possible, and that goes double for all you iPad warriors
- Many other bugs you’ve reported have been "dealt with”
