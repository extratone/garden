## Save markdown files of all Tot contents - combined and per individual dot.

This shortcut uses the new actions present in Iconfactory’s [Tot](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tot/id1491071483) and [Tot Pocket](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tot-pocket/id1498235191) to save the contents of all 7 Dots as numerically-titled Markdown files (1.md, 2.md, etc.) in a folder of your specification. It will also save the *combined* contents of the Dots - separated by `---` by default - to a file entitled tot.md. 

Upon installation, you will be given the option to set a permanent directory for backups as well as specify a different type of separator.
