- [r/Shortcuts](https://reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/syc5zq/whats_your_most_frequently_used_shortcutautomation/)

I dabbled with shortcuts a bit last year, but I’ve been wanting to make something I’ll actually use again. What’s your most frequently used one? 

I’ve set up “one sec” (thanks, u/Develobear !) for when I open Instagram, and it’s great. I oftentimes won’t even bother clicking on it now, knowing that I have to wait to launch it.

It’s absurd and I probably repeat it too often, but out of the thousands of Siri Shortcuts I’ve downloaded/[developed](https://routinehub.co/user/blue)/discarded over these past few years, the one I *absolutely* use the most is called “[cut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/6418f65c0153408086cf15a5378c2e04)” and all it does is disable Bluetooth and WiFi completely lol. (something the buttons in control center should/use to do... but do not.)

in terms of actual *automations*, the highest run count undoubtedly belongs to the one that enables orientation lock every time I leave the house. (my iPhone is my primary writing space and I do so often in landscape mode.)
