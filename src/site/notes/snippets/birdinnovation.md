# Mastodon Vs. Twitter Innovation

## Character Count

Mastodon's platform allows instance admins to customize post length, up to 5000 characters. The most popular instances including mastodon.social have a post limit of 500 characters. (Since launch in 2016.)

"[Giving you more characters to express yourself](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2017/Giving-you-more-characters-to-express-yourself.html)" | Twitter Blog (September 26, 2017)

Twitter announces it's going to "try out" a doubled character limit (280) just five months after Mastodon's Big Week (when it was circulated around popular tech media.)

## Custom "Conversations" Visibility

"[New conversation settings, coming to a Tweet near you](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/new-conversation-settings-coming-to-a-tweet-near-you.html)" | Twitter Blog (August 11, 2020)

## Audio Posts

[Initial resistance](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/issues/7495#issuecomment-389511213): 

> As-is, Mastodon is not a file sharing service. Even though it allows people to attach images and videos to toots, there is no expectation of format or quality fidelity (e.g. max 8MB videos, webm/mp4 only, jpg/png only, large images are downsized to at most 1280^2 pixels). So even though you could encode a song in a video, it's far from sharing MP3 or FLAC files. You can't share ZIP archives. You can't send someone a PSD file.
>
> I think it was a good decision to not allow audio uploads. Yes maybe it would've been fine. Or maybe the media would have branded Mastodon as a pirated music sharing service, and our project would start getting blocked from search results. Not a risk I am interested in taking *at all* when the most simple solution is to just include a link to soundcloud, instaud.io, vocaroo.com, dropbox, google cloud, your own server, or whatever else. Mastodon should not be a file sharing service!! It's a specialized problem domain with specialized solutions.

"[Your Tweet, your voice](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/your-tweet-your-voice.html)" | Twitter Blog (June 17, 2020)

"Add audio uploads" - [Tootsuite Version 2.9.1](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/releases/tag/v2.9.1), June 22, 2019. (From [Mastodon Changelog](https://github.com/extratone/mastodon/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md))

## Editable Posts

Mastodon's Delete and Redraft feature.

"[If you could edit tweets](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/06/if-you-could-edit-tweets/)" | Mastodon Blog (June 19, 2018)

Twitter seemed to be testing *the exact same fucking function* [in September](https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1305278528875892740). 

## Image Descriptions

[May 27th, 2020 Tweet](https://twitter.com/TwitterA11y/status/1265689579371323392)

"image descriptions for screen readers," "[Mastodon 2.0](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2017/10/mastodon-2.0/)" (October 19, 2017)

@TwitterA11y. "Adding descriptions to images is a great way to include everyone in your conversation. These descriptions, aka alt-text, enable folks who use screen readers to interpret images in Tweets. Starting today, you no longer need a setting to add alt text and it's available on ðŸ“± & ðŸ’»." *Twitter*, 27 May. 2020, 12:01 p.m., twitter.com/TwitterA11y/status/1265689579371323392.
