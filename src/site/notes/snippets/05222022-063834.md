“I’m fucking laughing” is what I was about to attach to this but it would have been a blatant lie. I don’t think anyone on earth wants to hear what I have to say but.... https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/21/23079058/apple-self-service-iphone-repair-kit-hands-on

this is why the RIGHT to repair thing has always got me laughin. the fucking DIY Modelo fix-it-urself nutso american dad mentality unleashed on a pocket mirror with 2 BILLION transistors sealed inside. general tech brodum’s priorities are somehow even more ridiculous.

THIS is the issue into which you choose to invest your energy. the RIGHT to incur one enormous pain in the ass. you dipshit. but a system matching *known child porn imagery* by *hashes*???? KEEP THAT AWAY FROM ME. fuck those kids, I have a RIGHT to my p r i v a c y.

the Grand American Tradition of absolutely unprecedented privilege/enormous power interwoven with relentlessly INCONCEIVABLE heights of pureblood idiocy is under ZERO THREAT.

it is THRIVING.
