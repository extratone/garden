# The Other Woman
Delicate whisper notes
Fragile crystalline jewels
in freefalling tumble
down to my lips

They hang there
in a minor wail
The surface of the pool
l rippled into hills
Each crest in time
with the soft balsa hammers
striking
my cheeks
Light linen kisses

===

Night is sanctuary and observatory of
Ends
Day is just the means to them
Tick in arc away the rations
and moderate considerations
I like big claims
because I make them
I donâ€™t like winding down
I prefer to run-leap
and tumble
