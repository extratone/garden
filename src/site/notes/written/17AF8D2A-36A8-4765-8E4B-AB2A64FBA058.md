# The Sunshine Omen

`legacy`

I'm afraid I've just found the first forlorn junebug,

dead on the third basement stair

the humid Showing Bowl has collected its things,

and we're off for summer's constantly oversaturated senses.

I'm afraid for nothing, no more

but what disturbance your season girds of my words
