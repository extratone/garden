Regarding the “How to use keyboard shortcuts” section in the [How to use Twitter for iOS](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-ios-app) support document, I was wondering if it might be updated in the near future to reflect the iOS app’s current support. (If you were not aware, the able is very incorrect at the moment.)

Thank you!
