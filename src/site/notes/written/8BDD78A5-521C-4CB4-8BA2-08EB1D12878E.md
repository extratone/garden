# Marco! Test
Coincidentally, I’m about to publish the shortcut I’ve definitely worked the hardest on. It is designed to be the definitive *Marco Polo* shortcut, if that makes sense.

Here’s [an iCloud share link](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/76d33dfc235942489c810dd3e73a4c06) to a version with all of the different ideas for noisemaking in an entertaining way in one huge, insane **test** shortcut. (Warning: You will hear my voice, along with Siri reading The Navy SEAL copypasta so… Not for testing around small children.)

I also just uploaded [a rough video demo](https://youtu.be/rmSf5jdN9Lo) of this specific version.

I know it’s absurd in many ways, but the notion of creating this shortcut is as old as SIri Shortcuts are, for me, so of course, I would love any/all feedback you may have.
