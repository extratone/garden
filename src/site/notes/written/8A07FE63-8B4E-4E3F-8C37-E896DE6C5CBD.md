# Hourology App Store Review

![Hourology Icon](https://tilde.town/~extratone/icons/hourology.png)

## Finally! A tasteful, useful, and delightful use of widgets.

I am not a widget man. As an iPhone-only user, I generally find them obtrusive and less-than-useful, and have since their introduction. [**Hourology**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hourology/id1564950603), though, really is a revelation. Having run out of working wristwatches and switched to working mostly from my phone, I’ve kept the single Hourology widget on my number one homescreen for the past week or so and found it ideal. (This is a big deal, believe it or not.) The configurability is stellar and *so* worthwhile for something you look at every day. I’m very glad the level of customization was included despite this perception that End Users are scared of taking control of their own technology. I feel like whomever came up with the idea for Hourology and I would make great friends hehe.
