# Timestamp Share Feedback-Whyp

just a thought on *simple as possible*:

imo Whyp’s specific use (musicians) might appreciate timestamp sharing that’s a little more precise than the standard 1 second increment (like YouTube.) what if it were to the tenth or - dare I say… hundredth decimal? it would be unconventional but distinctly so imo.
