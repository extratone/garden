# Radical Minutia Social Post

this year has been a real huge trip for me for reasons that don’t particularly have anything to do with the pandemic (a privilege.) ya might say I’m a detail-oriented person, now.

anywho, this is actually a Real Podcast Episode in that it’s not me monologuing just to my phone… but IS me monologuing to two relatively innocent bystanders. (complicit ones though!) 

if you happened to be wondering whether or not I have finally lost it, this is probably the most definitive answer. https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ImyC2Twm5qyx9lxmcKmkP
