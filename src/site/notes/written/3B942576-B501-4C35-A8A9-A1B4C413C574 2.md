This initial or trailing number in the range can be omitted to indicate the beginning or end, i.e. [[line|2..]] is line 2 through the end of the draft, [[line|..4]] is the first for lines of the draft. This tag also support negative indexes, which count back from the last line of the draft, e.g. [[line|-1]] returns the last line of the draft.
