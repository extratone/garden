this episode is basically idea after idea/discussion after discussion that I've also been thinking a lot about lately but haven't had anybody to chat about with. most personally shareable Tomorrow episode of all time, I think, and I've been listening to this goddamned show for like 6 years. https://pca.st/episode/83e76276-5b92-4794-91f0-4d7cde3fcf5e?t=4688.0
