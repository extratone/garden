# Bookmark Folders

![Bookmark Folders - Twitter Blue](https://i.snap.as/VyMNqr7V.png)

Bookmarks and **Bookmark Folders**** represent yet further evidence that someone at Twitter, Inc. *actually uses Twitter* (or perhaps has a friend or family member.) Technically, they also represent one of few core functions exclusive to Twitter’s own clients. (Consider: Tweetbot even supports polls, now.) However, like the Thread Reader and “Custom Themes,” Bookmark Folders, too, feel like an afterthought shoved in the bundle an hour before a deadline. Specifically, their color-coded icons look like placeholders for custom images… which aren’t supported, and they represent 0 additional function as curatorial/archival tools (no exporting/aggregating/or sorting, even) beyond simply nesting bookmarks into… folders.
